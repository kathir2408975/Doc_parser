      "- 1. Nigeria is the most populous country and the largest economy of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) . With over 200 million people and an estimated Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US$421 billion in 2021, Nigeria is by far the most populous country and largest economy in the region. With an estimated 80 million people living in poverty, Nigeria is central to the WBG's mission of eliminating poverty globally.\n",
      "- 2. Nigeria's development progress has stagnated since 2015. Between 2001 and 2014 Nigeria was a rising growth star in West Africa, with an average growth rate of 7 percent per year, and among the top 15 fastest growing economies in the world. The rising tide stopped since 2015 due to: (1) a decline in oil prices; (2) increased insecurity; (3) a reversal of macroeconomic reforms and heightened unpredictability of economic policies; and (4) more recently, the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, growth reduced to a 1.1 percent average between 2015 and 2021. The subdued economic growth, coupled with a rapid increase in population at 2.6 percent per year, one of the highest in the region, widened the gap in real GDP per capita between Nigeria and its peers. 1\n",
      "- 3. In 2021-2022, the economy recovered from the recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and lower oil prices and real GDP growth exceeded population growth for the first time since 2015, but welfare has continued to deteriorate. Following the contraction of 1.8 percent in 2020, the Nigerian economy grew by 3.6 percent in 2021 and it is projected to grow by 3.2 percent in 2022. However, the recovery seen in 2021 is not enough to cover the per capita income losses of the last 6 years. By the end of 2022, a Nigerian is projected to have the same level of income per capita as in 2011 and it will take about a decade to return to the same level of GDP per capita seen in 2014. Moreover, high inflation since 2020 has pushed an estimate of 12 million Nigerians into poverty. 2\n",
      "- 4. For the first time in Nigeria's history, rising oil prices are worsening Nigeria's net fiscal position. Nigeria's fiscal  position  has  typically  improved  during  episodes  of  high  oil  prices  thanks  to  higher  oil  revenues transferred to the Federation. However, since 2021, the increase in oil revenues has been outweighed by the increase in Nigeria's petrol (Premium Motor Spirit, PMS) subsidy. The cost of the petrol subsidy is enormous and volatile. Moreover, crude oil output declined by 8.3 percent in 2021 and reached a three-decade low because of enduring technical and security challenges as well as ageing infrastructure.\n",
      "- 5. The outlook for Nigeria's growth is uncertain and dependent on external factors and the government's policy response to longstanding issues. Nigeria's growth is expected to remain above population growth in 2022-2023, averaging 3.2 percent. The country's economic outlook remains uncertain. The projected recovery is threatened by: (1) the impact of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on the global economy through lower capital flows, heightened uncertainty, higher prices of imported food and inputs for fertilizers, lower global growth,  and  volatile  oil  prices;  (2)  lower-than-expected  oil  production  due  to  technical  inefficiencies;  (3) increased  insecurity;  (4)  higher  uncertainty  on  policy  direction  arising  from  the  upcoming  February  2023 general elections; and (5) worsening fiscal risks related to the PMS subsidy deductions.

      "- 6. Nigeria's vulnerability to climate shocks has increased due to a combination of political, geographic, and social factors and, specifically, the recent spike in insecurity in the country . 3 These shocks, manifesting in  the  form  of  natural  hazards,  floods,  storms,  and  ocean  surges  impact  the  economy  and  by  extension, peoples' livelihoods. The country's exposure to climate risks varies by regions and states. States in the Niger Delta Region and those along the coastal areas face considerable risks from storm surges along the entire coast, inland flooding, and wildfires. In the northern part of Nigeria, where aridity and a changing climate are causing  significant  disruption,  extreme  land  degradation  generates  desertification  and  severe  cases  of drought. Climate change trends in Nigeria are expected to increase the risk and intensity of flooding through increased  frequency  and  intensity  of  rain  while  states  in  the  central  and  eastern  part  are  expected  to experience  increased  aridity  and  drought.  These  climate-related  risks  can  have  severe  implications  on livelihoods and result in increased food insecurity, famine, population displacement, conflicts, and biodiversity loss. Climate inaction could cost Nigeria between 6-30 percent of GDP by 2050, equivalent to a loss of US$100460 billion. 4\n",

      "- 7. Catalyzing private investment is needed to boost growth and create jobs; however, Nigeria's ability to attract  domestic  and  foreign  investment  is  low  compared  to  its  peers .  The  contribution  of  investment (domestic  and  foreign)  to  GDP  growth  has  been  small,  due  to  limited  fiscal  space  and  a  weak  business environment: between 2015 and 2021, investment contributed 0.1 percentage points to the average GDP growth rate  of  1.1  percent.  FDI  to  Nigeria  was  0.6  percent  of  GDP  on  average  between  2016  and  2019, compared to 1.8 percent for SSA and 3.3 percent for lower-middle-income countries. 5\n",
      "- 8. Low investment in a context of low competitiveness has resulted in a decline of medium-sized and productive firms, critical for economic growth and good jobs. Low productivity is pervasive across several sectors  in  the  Nigerian  economy.   Large  firms  in  Nigeria  are  concentrated  in  telecommunications,  oil 6 production,  and  the  financial  sector,  and  are  the  most  productive,  but  have  not  been  able  to  generate productivity spillovers. Nigeria has approximately 41.5 million micro, 71,000 small, and 1,800 medium-sized enterprises. Out of these micro firms, only 2.1 percent are formally registered.  Informal firms are only a third 7 as productive as formal firms, yet employ over three times more workers in total, pointing to informality as a potential source of labor misallocation.

      "- 9. Private sector investment's contribution to growth has declined due to macroeconomic and financial policies, largely in the purview of the Federal Government, that constrain exports and investment. Nigeria's exchange  rate  management  policies  continue  to  discourage  investment.  Limited  interventions  in  the Importers' and Exporters' Foreign Exchange window and restrictions on access to foreign exchange for 45 items  adversely  affect  investor  confidence.  Foreign  exchange  restrictions,  import  bans,  and  closed  land borders reduce export competitiveness and hinder competition. 9 Commercial banks are reluctant to lend to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) at affordable rates as a result of, amongst others, the market  distortions  resulting  from  the  Central  Bank  of  Nigeria  (CBN)'s  subsidized  development  finance initiatives. 10 These  macroeconomic  and  financial  sector  policies  are  within  the  purview  of  the  Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) and the CBN.\n",
      "- 10. Lack of reliable power supply is another deterrent to private sector development in Nigeria, with annual economic losses due to unreliable power amounting to an estimated US$30 billion. In the absence of reliable power, 30 percent of SMEs and 26 percent of households are estimated to self-generate power with expensive gasoline generators, which combined have a net capacity eight times more than the national grid. 11\n",
      "- 11. Nigeria's 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) do have the ability to do their part to catalyze private investment but have varied significantly in their efforts and ability to do so. Total factor productivity (TFP) in the northern states (except Kano and Kaduna) is about one-third of TFP in the southern states. 12 A few states, such as Lagos, Kaduna, Kano, and Ogun, have made significant efforts to improve their businessenabling environment over the last 5 years, as reported by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC)'s ease of doing business and cost of compliance reports. These states rank as the top ten destinations of capital investment inflows, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Between 2017 and 2021 (Q2), Lagos State alone received 82.1 percent of the foreign capital inflows to Nigeria. By contrast, in 2020, about 26 states failed to attract foreign capital altogether.\n",
      "- 12. Several  critical  business-enabling  policy  actions  lie  within  the  domain  of  the  states. While  ongoing security concerns and unfinished reforms of FGN and CBN policies will discourage some types of investment (such as efficiency-seeking FDI), other types of investment (such as domestic investment, and some marketseeking FDI) are expected to be positively affected if several aspects of the business-enabling environment for firm operations are made more attractive by the states. States have a lot of room to improve, as most have not caught up with the business-enabling reform momentum witnessed in the reforming states. Beyond the security, macro-financial, and power constraints, several other constraints to a conducive business-enabling environment  fall  at  least  partly  within  the  purview  of  the  states  and  are  related  to:  (1)  ambiguous  and inconsistent land administration affecting land-based investments; (2) fiber optic infrastructure deficiencies; (3) weak public-private partnership (PPP) and investment policy frameworks; and (4) complex and uncertain business regulations related to firm operations, interstate and external trade, paying taxes, and contractual\n",

      "- 13. Across  Nigeria,  the  private  sector  faces  significant  hurdles  in  identifying  land  for  investment,  with uncertainty  around  ownership,  and  conflicts  ensuing  even  before  investments  begin. Registered  lands comprise an estimated 3 percent of Nigeria's landmass and are located primarily in urban areas. Data on land use, coverage and ownership is limited, and where it does exist, it is largely paper-based and inaccessible. A complex registration process contributes to most transactions taking place in the informal market. Except for in the South East, it takes on average between one and three months to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy (CofO) in Nigeria. An estimated 70 percent of transactions take place in the informal market. Lack of data affects states' ability to implement basic social and economic planning, discourages investment and limits the collection of property tax. Without land information systems and the data contained therein, investors and the state are also unable to determine the best-suited locations for investment. 13\n",
      "- 14. Ambiguous  and  inconsistent  land  administration  impacts  sustainable  land-based  investments. The existing laws and regulations, including the 1978 Land Use Act, have several shortcomings. 14 Regulations to guide states and ensure consistency in implementation have not been enacted. Customary practices coexist with statutory land laws, which results in conflicting land administration frameworks. As a result, there are several challenges and risks in the operationalization of current laws and processes, which can impact landbased private investment. These include: (1) documentation and spatial information concerning existing rights are weak, especially in rural areas; (2) land allocation decisions based on the principle that the government owns all land sometimes fails to take into account the legal and constitutional recognition of customary uses of rural communities; (3) the legal status of common areas is uncertain, despite the fact that such areas are critical for livelihoods of rural communities; (4) compulsory acquisition processes and compensation standards are at times not consistent with best practice; (5) excessive reliance on compulsory acquisition to assemble land for private investment may limit the potential involvement of local communities as genuine partners in an  investment;  (6)  benefit  arrangements  may  be  vaguely  defined  and  constrained  by  weak  community capacity to negotiate; (7) weak capacity in the state government to conduct land acquisition and reallocation efficiently and fairly; and (8) government identification of land for large-scale investment is not always based on robust environmental and social impact assessment. 15\n",
      "- 15. Some states have piloted innovative approaches that conform with international standards and good practices for responsible and inclusive land-based investments. Jigawa State adopted the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) in April 2018. LARF was a substantial step towards ensuring responsible investments  by  emphasizing  the  state  acquisition  of  land  with  full  compensation  and  resettlement requirements.

Customary  norms,  lack  of  available  information,  and  costly  property  registration  frameworks  have resulted in a large gender gap in statutory rights of occupancy, with only 10.7 percent of women having rights to a dwelling either alone or jointly in 2018, four times less than men . 17 In agriculture, women without land have limited control over farming practices and input supply systems, which affects their productivity and income generating capacities. In such customary systems, access to land is determined by male relatives and  customary  laws,  disadvantaging  women.  In  cases  of  involuntary  resettlements,  women  are  more susceptible to disproportionate displacement impacts because compensation is often paid to the head of the household, which culturally are often men, even if the impacted assets are actively used by women.\n",
      "- 17. Increase  in  private  investment  can  have  implications  on  climate  vulnerability,  particularly  for  landbased investments, depending on the accompanying land-use activities. If  private  investment  results  in burning,  decomposition  of  waste  forest  matter,  soil  degradation  in  cleared  land,  rice  fields,  and  use  of fertilizers and chemicals in agricultural land, these activities can generate externalities thereby counteracting the full realization of the expected development impacts of increased investment in a state. 18 These risks will be minimized if states attract foreign and domestic firms with stronger environmental management standards and performance. Increased energy demand resulting from increased investment can also have implication on the country's climate vulnerability status. While clean energy sources can potentially reduce the country's vulnerability, burning fossil fuels to produce electricity can compound the situation. 19\n",

Only 10 states reported applying aggregate fees of at most NGN145 per meter for ROW and related fees such as reinstatement. 22 Relatedly, it has been reported by private operators that some states have restructured the reduced ROW fees into new administrative or reinstatement fees. In terms of transparency of processes for obtaining ROW, only Lagos has a website outlining fees, processes, and contact information of the state ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) for obtaining approval to lay fiber. Reducing aggregate fees charged for fiber deployment would significantly lower unit deployment costs and therefore increase deployment: If aggregate per-meter fees charged by all states and FCT were to be reduced to the targeted level, the cost of dark fiber deployment to reach NBP targets would decline from US$3.4 billion to US$1 billion as the ROW portion of the cost would drop from US$2.5 billion to US$150 million.

Currently, only a few states have put in place a robust legal and institutional framework and well-defined roles and mandates that allow PPPs to be developed and ensure a clear process for PPPs.\n",

The NDP 2021-2025 sets a target of increasing FDI by over 230 percent to US$5 billion in the next 3 years. To be able to attract, retain and expand FDI, countries need to make targeted and proactive efforts to improve their policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks. IPAs can play a pivotal role in helping countries attract and realize the development benefits of FDI. Well-performing IPAs have, amongst others,  a  strong  mandate,  clear  governance  structure,  and  adequate  funding,  institutional  partnerships, internal  systems,  monitoring  and  evaluation  metrics  and  human  resources. 25 The  Nigerian  Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) plays a central role in investment promotion at the federal level, although there remain areas that can be further improved (e.g., mandate and scope of activities, subnational coordination, investor targeting, investor information and assistance services).\n",
      "- 24. With investors increasingly evaluating locations at the subnational level (city, province, state), having adequate investment promotion frameworks in Nigeria's states has become critical . Subnational IPAs can help  generate  FDI  inflows  and  large-scale  domestic  investments  at  the  local  level.  This  impact  is  more pronounced in less-developed jurisdictions, likely pointing to the role of subnational IPAs in helping investors address  information  gaps,  inadequate  transparency,  and  weaker  institutional  conditions.  Compared  to national IPAs, subnational IPAs require deeper knowledge of the local business environment and its value proposition to investors, and stronger ties to local agencies involved in the day-to-day operational needs and issues facing investors.\n",

Although about 14 states now have an IPA responsible for designing and implementing strategies to attract, retain and service investors in the state, only a few of these are adequately resourced and have demonstrated the capacity to be able to attract investment .

Although the use of investment incentives is widespread across countries, they play a limited role in investor-decision making. They are known to be effective under specific conditions, specifically,  when the overall policy environment and investment climate is conducive. 26 Where countries grant  investment  incentives,  it  is  important  to  ensure  cost-effectiveness  of  the  incentives  granted,  and transparency on their availability and administration. In Nigeria, incentives are offered at the federal and state levels. The NIPC, in collaboration with the Federal Inland Revenue Service, published the Compendium on Investment Incentives in 2017. While dated, this compendium provides an overview of some of the main incentives  available  to  investors,  mainly  at  the  federal  level.  States  do  not  publish  similar  standardized, updated information either on the available incentives, nor the number of recipients of incentives.

Aspects of the business regulatory environment affecting firm operations such as tax administration, fees and levies for inter-state trade, exporter certification, and courts and the resolution of commercial  disputes,  impose  significant  compliance  costs  on  businesses.  The  lack  of  transparency  and unpredictability in many of these services also deter private sector trust in the government. Where regulations are restrictive and procedural requirements too time-consuming or costly, entrepreneurs are less likely to formally  start and  operate  businesses  and  abide  by  legal  requirements,  and  small  businesses  are disproportionately affected.\n",

The lack of transparency and unpredictability in government-to-business services impacts private sector trust in the government, which in turn can deter investment. 27 Access  to  information to state and local government official fees, requirements and timelines needed for obtaining a service from government, as well as information on upcoming changes would enhance the ability of businesses to plan for the impact of policy changes. In June 2022, 31 states, including FCT, had official state websites, but most lack relevant information on operating a business in their state. Half of the existing 31 state websites do not have contact details (e.g., emails or telephone numbers) that a potential or existing investor could use to gather more information,\n",

According to the PEBEC ease of doing business survey 2021,on average, businesses spend about 9 percent of their revenues on transportation costs and these costs can be as high as 40-70 percent in Lagos, FCT, Bauchi, Abia and Cross River. In Nigeria, interstate haulage fees vary from state to state and can be high, thereby reducing the incentive to move goods across states and abroad.

      "- 30. The benefits of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) are limited by three trade barriers that affect export competitiveness in Nigeria. First, the applied tariff rate is twice that of its continental peers. The effective tax burden is higher on intermediate goods than on consumer goods, thereby increasing the likelihood of an anti-export bias. A Nigerian firm pays on average 13.7 percent more for the commodities it uses in its production than it would pay in the absence of import tariffs. Second, Nigeria ranks low among key trade  facilitation  indicators  measured  by  the OECD. 29 Further,  Nigeria's  rank  in  the  Logistics  Performance Index (LPI) has significantly deteriorated from 92 nd in 2016 to 147 th (out of 160) in 2018, lagging behind most of its peers, except for Angola (160 th ). Third, the current import restrictions (import bans, foreign exchange restrictions, and border closures) result in high production costs, loss of revenue from smuggling and illegal exports, and higher prices for consumers. In addition, replacing long-standing import bans with tariffs (equal to the tariffs applied to similar products) could lift an estimated 3.3 million Nigerians out of poverty. 30\n",
      "- 31. While these trade barriers  require  federal  policy  reforms,  states  and  FCT  can  support  exporters  by having functioning state export promotion agencies that connect firms with international markets . There is evidence that export promotion agencies contribute positively to increasing exports, through the intensive or extensive  trade  margin.  That  is,  increasing  export  volume  and  value,  and  diversification  in  terms  of destinations and markets. 31 In the case of Nigeria, export promotion activities at the state level can help firms overcome some of the trade barriers they face in foreign markets and remove information asymmetries. This is particularly important for SMEs and new firms entering exports. 32\n",

The regimes of presumptive taxation for micro and small businesses in several states are complex and difficult to comply with, multiple layers of taxation cause additional challenges to firms, and most payment systems do not use modern technological solutions and are inefficient. In several states 33 the presumptive tax regimes are very complex with a large number of business categories, and different rates for micro, small, and medium-sized firms within each category. For example, in Kaduna there are 40 businesses specified along with fixed rates for each, resulting in 120 different rates. There are several policy and implementation issues that  arise,  such  as:  unclear  basis  of  definition  of  micro,  small,  or  medium-sized  firms;  unclear  basis  of determination of fixed or lumpsum rates; businesses pay the same fixed fee, even in bad years; the fixed rates are  regressive;  and  several  business  categories  overlap  leading  to  discretion  that  could  encourage  rentseeking behavior. For state revenue, these rates are fixed and not indexed to inflation, which means in real terms the tax value is declining over time as in Nigeria inflation is high, averaging between 16-18 percent.\n",
      "- 33. In addition, in some instances, there is no clear delineation of taxes between agencies, especially at the state and local level, and the rationale for the taxation fee or levy is not always clear. Businesses are often in a position of having paid one state agency and essentially the same taxes being followed up by another collecting agency. The State Revenue Laws developed to meet the disbursement linked indicator (DLI 4.1) of the  State  Fiscal  Transparency,  Accountability  and  Sustainability  (SFTAS)  Program-for-Results  (P162009) provided that all state revenue sources along with their rates be approved by the State House of Assembly along with the sources and rates applicable for the local authorities of the state. In many, but not all cases, states put in provisions for the state authorities to collect on behalf of the local authorities some of their revenues such as tenement rates and some larger market rates. 34\n",
      "- 34. In terms of compliance, taxpayers face continued difficulties . In several states, even after payments are made to government, receipts are often required to be resubmitted to the agencies before further action is taken. By rationalizing and streamlining the tax compliance process, payments could be made easier and clearer  for  businesses  avoiding  repeated  interaction  with  the  collection  bodies.  This  would  increase compliance and reduce time spent on paying taxes.\n",

According to the 2021 PEBEC ease of doing business Subnational Survey, only 8 percent of surveyed SMEs had utilized the judicial system to enforce a breach of law, and when they do, businesses spent an average of 6.3 percent of their revenue on court costs. The low utilization of courts may be attributed to the relative high costs and complexity of the judicial process, and the overall difficulty in gaining access to justice. In addition, the time taken to receive justice for commercial disputes negatively affects businesses and potential litigants across Nigeria. According to the subnational doing business survey 2018, resolving a commercial  dispute  across  Nigerian  states  takes  475  days  and  costs  37  percent  of  the  claim  value,  on average. 35\n",

The proposed Program is expected to be a subset of the government's program to improve the business enabling environment at the state level. The use of the PforR instrument helps  the  World  Bank  to  support  the  government  in  strengthening  its  own  program  by  incentivizing institutional performance at the state level through results-based financing, thereby creating a strong mutual accountability  framework  between  the  federal  government  and  the  states.

The Program will address several of the underlying factors driving the gender gap in statutory rights  of  occupancy  between  men  and  women,  to  the  disadvantage  of  women,  specifically  the  lack  of information and awareness among women and men of the benefits of statutory rights of occupancy (for women and of co-ownership of certificate of occupancies) and lack of transparency regarding the property registration process. It will build on the experience in Kaduna State which successfully piloted an approach in the years 2016 to 2022 in which it provided a mix of financial incentives and targeted promotion of statutory rights of occupancy for women. 42 Gender-disaggregated baseline data is available in Lagos, Edo, and Kano States.  According to information provided by the states, in 2021, the share of female owned or jointly owned CofO registrations out of all CofO registrations that year was 7 percent (Lagos), 26 percent (Edo), and 5 percent (Kano). For other states, the Program will incentivize the collection of gender-disaggregated data as a Prior Result and by supporting-through the Disbursement-linked Results (DLRs)-the establishment of a digital CofO  database  with  data  that  is  gender-disaggregated.  The  Program  will  aim  to  reduce  the  gender  gap between men and women, to the disadvantage of women, in at least Lagos, Edo and Kano States by: (1) making CofO procedures public; (2) collecting gender-disaggregated CofO data; (3) implementing a financial incentive for registration of female owned or jointly-owned CofOs, making it cheaper for women to register their statutory rights of occupancy; and (4) putting in place a communications campaign aimed at promoting woman and/or joint  registration  of  statutory  rights  of  occupancy  by  dissolving  cultural  and  social  norms affecting  women's  understanding  and  perception  of  their  rights  to  own  or  co-own  statutory  rights  of occupancy and occupy land. To ensure that women are reached through the communication campaign, it will be  conducted  through  several  channels  such  as  the  Open  Government  System  (OGS),  social  media,  the National Orientation Agency (NOA), as well as women-focused NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs).

This  will  include  a  strong consultative component to ensure the process is subject to public scrutiny, utilizing (i) a stakeholder engagement strategy to outline the consultation process; (ii) a social audit to ensure the satisfaction of all stakeholders; and (iii) community grievance redressal and conflict resolution mechanisms. 43 The FRILIA  implementation  consultation  process  would  be  undertaken  by  the  relevant  states,  with capacity support from the World Bank, to help the implementation agencies understand the core components of a FRILIA. After the adoption of a FRILIA the states would embark on an agency-wide consultation  and  stakeholders  buy-in  process,  and  then  set  up  steering  committees.  The  FRILIA principles would be customized to the institutional arrangements in each of the states. This process, called  'unbundling  the  FRILIA  framework'  is  usually  led  by  independent  consultants,  wherein  the consultants engage thoroughly with all stakeholders (MDAs, non-state actors, community stakeholders 44 ) with a core interest in FRILIA. At the completion of the unbundling process, there is a sign-off of FRILIA by the stakeholders. Social audits would confirm the satisfactory implementation of FRILIA, which would ensure successful citizen engagement in the process.\n",
      "- (b) DLI5 on increased transparency of official fees and procedures will allow for citizen engagement through GRMs focused on the business regulatory environment. GRMs would be housed under key state-level business-enabling environment MDAs, and the DLR-linked disbursement will require that these GRMs are operational and address a minimum of 50 percent of grievances within the specified service level agreements. This DLI will also require advance communication to the public on upcoming state-level changes to legislation, regulations, and fees.\n",
      "- 54. Climate  Mitigation  and  Adaptation  measures. The  Program  is  expected  to  contribute  to  climate mitigation and adaption measures. In recognition that Nigeria is vulnerable to climate factors and constrained in its capacity to respond to natural hazards, efforts to strengthen resilience to climate change effects are crucial  for  the  development  and  sustainable  growth  of  the  country.  Climate  mitigation  and  adaptation considerations are built into some of the DLIs and the proposed activities required to achieve the DLRs. The Program will contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation through the development and implementation of FRILIA, which will ensure that all large land acquisition and investments that materialized following the adoption  of  such  a  framework  at  the  state  level  are  carried  out  in  a  safe,  equitable,  inclusive,  and environmentally responsible manner. Second, the Program will support States at ensuring that PPP pipeline projects  will  be  screened  for  climate  adaptation  and  mitigation.  Thirdly,  the  Program  will  contribute  to reduction in GHG emissions through support towards increased transparency of official fees, procedures using states official websites and establishment of e-platforms for paying taxes, levies, and fees (Annex 9).\n",

While the Program does not have private financing as part of its  program costs, the Operation does aim to address binding constraints to enable sustainable private sector solutions, as identified in the CPF and the CPSD, and includes ongoing private sector engagement, and thus can be considered MFD-enabling. The NDP includes significant private sector mobilization as its goal. All results areas aim to create a business-enabling environment more conducive to private financing.

The  SFTAS  PforR  incentivized  states  to  improve  in  four  result  areas:  (1) increased  fiscal  transparency  and  accountability;  (2)  strengthened  domestic  revenue  mobilization;  (3) increased efficiency in public expenditure; and (4) strengthened debt transparency and sustainability. Results were measured across four annual performance assessments during 2018-2021 in which state performance increased year on year, exceeding expectations and disbursing US$1.5 billion. As SFTAS winds down, the focus is on sustainability of the results achieved in the absence of the PforR incentive.  SABER is a natural component of the sustainability strategy as it will:\n",
      "- (a) Continue  to  use  the  two  SFTAS  eligibility  criteria  for  access  to  the  funds,  providing  a  continued incentive for the timely publication of NCOA compliant budgets and IPSAS compliant audited financial statements. These are foundational to sound fiscal management and can foster increased budget responsiveness and accountability.\n",

      "- (c) Sustain the highly constructive platform of mutual accountability between the states and the federal government, and of peer learning across states.\n",
      "- 59. Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs). Ex-ante, the Program is open to all states given the nature of the reforms, but states must indicate ex-ante, each year for the purpose of organizing TA, which (sub)DLIs they wish to achieve 47 and, each year, each state must satisfy the annual Eligibility Criteria as a prerequisite to being part of the Program's results-based financing. The Program has a common set of DLIs that are expected to be relevant to the business-enabling environment challenges in all states. The DLIs include a mix of inputs and outputs, and intermediate outcomes and outcomes to create the right balance between realism and ambition (Table 6, Annex 2). Under each DLI, a set of DLRs are specified with target dates for completion and specific  disbursement  amounts  associated  with  each  DLR.  The  DLRs  are  designed  to  account  for  the heterogeneity among participating states, while incentivizing strengthened performance from both lagging and advanced states: (1) some DLRs are formulated relative to the state's baseline (i.e., a percentage increase from the baseline); (2) states can choose the DLIs they want to target for reforms based on priorities in the state;  and  (3)  DLRs  may  have  basic  and  stretch  targets  to  enable  'lagging'  states  to  participate,  while incentivizing states that begin at a more advanced position to still do more. Because a few states have already made progress on some of the DLRs in the past and since disbursements under SABER cannot be made against past performance, in a few instances stretch DLRs (amounting to US$8 million) have been specified to enable these states to earn the maximum possible disbursement should they achieve the stretch DLRs. The Program will  support  results over three years, giving adequate time for implementing more complex reforms, and incentivizing sustained improvements across years. The size of each state's loan will depend on the number of  DLIs  achieved  each  year.  The  Program  will  promote  healthy  competition  among  states,  within  certain boundaries. The Program is expected to have the same fixed value for the same DLR for all states. Should a state choose to participate and achieve all DLRs it would potentially receive a total disbursement of US$52.5 million  between  2022  and  2025.  Depending  on  actual  state  performance,  some  DLIs  will  be  over-  and underachieved,  requiring  Program  restructuring  during  implementation.

      "Rationale : Ambiguous and inconsistent land administration impacts sustainable land-based investments. An estimated 3 percent of land is registered, and an estimated 70 percent of transactions take place in the informal  sector.  Persistent  informality  of  land  markets  hinders  states'  collection  of  revenue,  precludes development of a modern cadaster and registration system, hinders land use planning efforts, limits access to  finance,  undermines  security  of  tenure,  and  contributes  to  GHG  emission.  Furthermore,  customary practices coexist with statutory land laws, which results in conflicting land administration frameworks. In this  environment,  the  private  sector  faces  significant  hurdles  in  identifying  land  for  investment,  with uncertainty around ownership, and the risk of conflicts to ensue before investments begin.\n",

      "Rationale: Fast, reliable, and accessible broadband is a key foundation for the growth of Nigeria's digital economy, but Nigeria's broadband infrastructure is underdeveloped. Only about 23 percent of Nigerians use  broadband  services,  and  companies  commonly  cite  lack  of  reliable  broadband  access  as  a  key constraint. Given broadband's potential to improve productivity and enable new ventures, studies find that a 10 percent increase in mobile broadband penetration is associated with up to 2.5 percent of additional GDP growth per annum in Africa. To achieve Nigeria's  NBP  2020-2025 targets,  Nigeria  needs  between 120,000 to 167,000 km of fiber infrastructure in addition to its current 55,000 km. At the state level, fiber deployment has been held back by excessive, untransparent, and inconsistent ROW fees, amongst other state levies.\n",

      "Rationale: Increasing  states'  infrastructure  stock  and  other  key  services  requires  mobilizing  private investment at scale. Many states have recognized PPPs as a financing option for their infrastructure stock. However, today, unclear institutional arrangements on how a PPP transaction is developed, vetted, and implemented, and conflicting agendas across government agencies stall investments from developing in a timely,  efficient,  and  consistent  fashion.  States  lack  adequate  risk-management  throughout  the  PPP lifecycle, particularly with regards to fiscal commitments and contingent liabilities.\n",

      "in  the  next  3  years.  Well-organized  IPAs  and  targeted  investment  promotion  efforts  are  critical  for governments to attract and retain FDI. Nigeria's states lack IPAs with clear, legal mandates, appropriate internal organization, strategy, and capacity to deliver services to attract, support the establishment of and retain investors. There is currently also limited transparency on and access to updated information on the investment incentives available in states. Ensuring easier access to such information is key for investors to benefit  from  the  business  environment,  and  for  state  governments  to  reduce  inefficiencies.  Having  a published and up to date inventory of investment (including green investment) incentives is also the first step  to  rationalize  the  use  of  incentives  by  comparing  the  costs  and  benefits  and  determining  if  such incentives are appropriate, effective, and sufficiently targeted to meet a state's development objectives.\n",

      "\n",
      "Rationale: Access to information to state fees, requirements and timelines needed for obtaining a service from government bodies, as well as changes in regulations and fees is impeded by lack of timely easily accessible information. In addition, changes to official fees, procedures and requirements are done on an ad hoc basis making it difficult to know the most up to date information. Service delivery timelines are difficult to obtain and adherence to timelines are not measured or published to hold government bodies accountable. In most states, there is inadequate implementation of GRMs for complaints. Easier access to regulatory  information  such  as  fee  schedules  would  allow  for  greater  regulatory  efficiency,  lower compliance costs and better regulatory quality for businesses in the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Description: This DLI seeks to improve transparency and access to regulatory information by ensuring (i) the online publication of fees, procedures, service delivery timelines and mandatory advance communication of upcoming changes to fees and regulations of five key business-enabling environment MDAs  on state website(s); (ii) functional GRM at two key State-level business-enabling environment MDAs with grievances receiving a response within the specified service level agreement; and (iii) monitoring and public statistics of compliance to timelines for service delivery by the MDAs.\n",

      "DLI 6: Increased transparency of fees and levies for inter-state trade and increased exporter certification Rationale: On average businesses spend about 9 percent of their revenues on transportation costs and these costs can be as high as 40-70 percent in Lagos, FCT, Bauchi, Abia and Cross River. In Nigeria, interstate haulage fees vary from state to state and can be high, thereby reducing the incentive to move goods across states and abroad. In the absence of a uniform and transparent schedule of levies and fees, such measures make state borders increasingly thick. While most of the trade barriers that Nigerian firms face require federal policy reform, states can support exporters by having functioning state export promotion agencies that connect firms with international markets. There is evidence that export promotion agencies contribute positively to increasing exports.\n",

      "## DLI 7: Simplified state and local business tax regimes\n",
      "\n",
      "Rationale: In several states, the presumptive tax regimes are very complex with a large number of business categories, and different rates for micro, small, and medium-sized firms within each category. There are several policy and implementation issues that arise, such as unclear basis of definition of micro, small, or medium-sized firms; unclear basis of determination of fixed or lumpsum rates; businesses pay the same fixed fee, even in bad years; the fixed rates are regressive; and several business categories overlap leading to discretion that could encourage rent-seeking behavior. For the states' revenue, these rates are fixed and not indexed to inflation, which means in real terms the tax value is declining over time. There are multiple layers of taxation in Nigeria. State and Local taxes, fees and levies are opaque and difficult to understand. Businesses are often in a position of having paid one agency of state government and essentially the same taxes  being  followed  up  by  another  collecting  agency.  In  many  states  once  payments  are  made  to government, receipts are often required to be resubmitted to the agencies before further action is taken. Rationalizing  and  streamlining/harmonizing  the  business  tax  codes,  and  electronically  tracking  and receipting the consolidated business payments, would make it easier and clearer for businesses, avoiding repeated interaction with the collection bodies. This would increase compliance and reduce time spent on paying taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Description: This  DLI  supports  the  simplification  of  state  and  local  business  tax  regimes  increased transparency and harmonization of state taxes through (i) states amending existing legislation or passing new  legislation  to  adopt  presumptive  turnover  tax  regime  for  small  businesses;  (ii)  states  subsuming business-related  local  government  charges/fees/taxes  into  a  consolidated  demand  notice;  and  (iii)  the establishment of an electronic platform for the collection of taxes, levies and fees from businesses that provide an automated e-receipt generation.\n",

      "## DLI 8: Quick determination of commercial disputes\n",
      "\n",
      "Rationale: The  contractual  environment  and  enforcement  through  courts  is  weak  across  most  states, dampening business and investor confidence. Only 8 percent of SMEs, surveyed in 2021, had utilized the judicial system to enforce a breach of law, and when they do, businesses spent an average of 6.3 percent of their revenue on court costs. The low utilization of courts may be attributed to the relative high costs and complexity of the judicial process, and the overall difficulty in gaining access to justice. In addition, the time taken to receive justice for commercial disputes negatively affects businesses and potential litigants across Nigeria. According to the subnational doing business survey 2018, resolving a commercial dispute across  Nigerian  states  takes  475  days  and  costs  37  percent  of  the  claim  value,  on  average.  Simplified procedures or specialized courts for the resolution of small claims can enable policy makers to achieve two often competing goals at the same time: improving access to justice and increasing judicial efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Description: This  DLI  will  support  states  at  facilitating  access  to  justice,  in  particular  for  smaller  claims, through (i) the establishment of small claims courts for commercial disputes of MSMEs; (ii) instilling practice directions that facilitate access to justice and strengthen efficient court practices and encourage ADR; and (iii) the collection and publication of key performance reports for small claims courts.\n",

The arrangements will also benefit from the PEBEC-EBES structure, and the state level structures that were established in the context of the PEBEC-NEC subnational initiatives, including the state ease of doing business (EODB) councils and the state reform champions. The detailed institutional and implementation arrangements will be guided by the Program's operations manual.\n",

To support the implementation of the Program in each state, a state steering council will be  established  in  each  of  the  participating  states.  The  membership  of  the  council  will  include representation from the key state MDAs responsible for achieving the DLIs: governor's offices, state ministries of finance, budget and planning, state ministries of trade, investment, commerce and industry, state ministries of land and urban planning, state IPAs, and state judiciaries. In view of the link between the achievement of the Eligibility Criteria and the DLRs and state finances, and as the State Commissioner of Finance (COF) signs the Subsidiary Loan Agreement, the COF shall be represented on the council. As of August 2022, 32 states had appointed an EODB Reform Champion, and 17 states had established a State Steering Council, generally called EODB  Council.  Most  state  EODB  Councils  are  chaired  by  governors  or  deputy  governors,  but  other arrangements exist too. The suggested operating model is for the councils to be supported by coordinating offices, led by the reform champions. 49 The coordinating offices focus on implementation and monitoring, and provide monthly reporting to the EODB Council, which meets monthly. In this suggested 50 operating model, the EODB Council reports to the state executive council on a quarterly basis. Irrespective of the operating model chosen by the state, key responsibilities of each of the state councils are to approve the annual state business-enabling reforms action plan for achieving the Eligibility Criteria and the DLRs, which should include the annual capacity building activities for the state, to monitor progress of the annual state business-enabling\n",

The expenditure framework includes MDAs with a key role in implementing the business-enabling reforms that are part of the PforR.  Due to the cross-cutting nature of business-enabling reforms, these include a wide range of MDAs including the ministries that have a more cross-cutting role across the PforR: the ministries of finance/budget/planning and the governor's offices.  Given that these cross-cutting ministries have more of a horizontal role, their operating expenses are limited to 10 percent of the estimated recurring expenditures. The other MDAs that have a specific mandate supporting the PforR objectives are IPAs, the judiciary, the ministries of trade/investment/commerce/industry, and the ministries of land and urban planning.\n",

The PCU will also be tasked to hire an Independent Verification Agency to verify the achievement of DLRs.  The  M&amp;E  framework  is  mostly  composed  of  the  DLRs  themselves.  Detailed  implementation arrangements  including  data  collection  for  M&amp;E  and  DLI  verification  protocols,  financial  management, disbursement, and procurement rules will be documented in the Operations Manual to be developed by the Government with the help of the World Bank well before effectiveness.\n",
      "- 79. Program's economic rationale. As detailed in Annex 3, the net present value of the Program is positive and significant. The reforms supported by the Program would be targeted at improving the regulatory and legal environment for firms to enter and operate, improve transparency of and access to information for firms regarding  procedures  and  payments  of  taxes,  fees  and  levies  to  government,  and  provision  of  better regulatory frameworks to support private investment in, fiber optic infrastructure for broadband. The impact of  these  reforms  is  expected  to  fully  materialize  over  the  medium-term,  but  the  economic  assessment quantifies some of these gains over the period of the program (2023-25). The estimation of economic gains from this project are through the impact on states' GDP. Using the most conservative estimates, the net present value of the project calculated at a discount rate of 13 percent over the three-year period is estimated at US$542 billion.\n",

The Integrated Fiduciary Systems Assessment (IFSA) was conducted through review of the systems and practices  of  federal  PCU  and  all  states  (and  FCT),  relying  on  six  representative  states  combined  with information/  systems  reviewed  as  part  of  the  country  wide  SFTAS  and  CARES  programs'  fiduciary assessments. Review of fiduciary systems of key implementing agencies in the six representative states (Abia, Edo, Enugu, Gombe, Kaduna and Nasarawa), and the federal PCU was also carried out. Ongoing SFTAS results were  reviewed,  and  SFTAS  Charter  implementation  will  continue  to  be  reviewed  for  public  financial management  (PFM)  indicators.

The  fiduciary  systems,  institutions,  and  practices  of  the  representative  states combined with the results of the fiduciary assessments carried out under SFTAS and CARES provide reasonable assurance that Program resources will be used for the intended purposes and will support the achievement of Program objectives in an effective, efficient, and transparent manner, subject to full implementation of the Program Action Plan (PAP).\n",
      "- 82. Fiduciary Risk Assessment and Mitigation Measures. The overall Program integrated residual fiduciary risk (FM, procurement, and governance) is rated Substantial. The IFSA of the Program shows that the PCU and states  have the capabilities  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  the  financing  proceeds  will  be  used  for intended purposes with the objective of supporting the achievement of the Program objectives. However, the assessment found that there are some weaknesses and risks in the overall fiduciary systems of the Program, necessitating action plans to mitigate them. The key fiduciary risks are the following: (a) risk of delay in transfer of Program funds to the participating states; (b) weak internal controls over public expenditures in general, also leading to risk of inflated payroll and ghost workers in less than 25 percent of states that have committed to (through the SFTAS Charter, signed August 17, 2022), but have not yet strengthened payroll management and  management  of  ghost  workers;  and  (c)  weaknesses  in  compliance  with  the  established  legal  and institutional framework for combating fraud and corruption at the Program level, which could undermine the ability of the authorities to detect and address the occurrence of fraud and corruption risk in a timely and effective manner. These risks will be mitigated progressively through the implementation of the PAP.\n",
      "- 83. Fraud and corruption risks. The World Bank Anti-Corruption Guidelines will apply to the Program and GRMs will be implemented across the states and the implementing agencies. The Program governance and anti-corruption arrangements will rely largely on the country's national-level governance and anti-corruption arrangements.  The  Economic  and  Financial  Crimes  Commission  (EFCC),  Independent  Corrupt  Practices Commission (ICPC), and Nigeria Police handle investigations of fraud and corruption. Under the Program, the World  Bank  will  be  apprised  at  the  earliest  opportunity  of  all  allegations  and  complaints  of  fraud  and corruption related to the Program activities. A signed submission from the PCU shall be made every six months as part of the semi-annual progress reports using a template agreed with the World Bank. This submission shall  provide  details  of  any  allegations  or  complaints  on  fraud  and  corruption  regarding  any  part  of  the Program implementation, including status of actions taken.  Even where there are no allegations or complaints during a reporting period, positive assurance should be provided to the World Bank of this status.\n",
      "- 84. Additional provisions are required to mitigate the risk of fraud and corruption under the Program. Based on  this  assessment:  (a)  GRMs  will  be  implemented  across  key  state  implementing  agencies  involved  in Program implementation as part of DLIs 1, 5 and 6 and at the federal level as part of Project/Program-level GRM; (b) the World Bank Anti-Corruption Guidelines will apply to the PforR; and (c) a protocol for reporting, recording,  and  investigating  allegations  and  complaints  pertaining  to  fraud  and  corruption  will  be  agreed among the key implementing agencies. The protocol shall establish a framework of responsibilities for this purpose with clear identification of those charged with ensuring regular oversight and compliance.\n",

The IDA credit proceeds of the US$730 million PforR Program will be disbursed to the Federal Government's Special Fund Account, which serves as a sub-account of the TSA held with the CBN. This will be managed by the PCU. Upon receiving the decision to disburse from the World Bank, a Withdrawal Application will be submitted to the World Bank by the PCU, using the World Bank's standard disbursement forms through the e-disbursement functionality in the World Bank's Client Connection system. Disbursements under PforR will be triggered by the World Bank's decision to disburse after receiving and reviewing evidence of  the  achievement of  the  Program DLRs through the APA process. The PCU will make disbursements to individual participating states from the Special Fund Account to the respective Consolidated Revenue Fund accounts  of  the  state  governments  based  on  the  World  Bank's  Confirmation  of  Results  notice  which  will indicate the individual states' APA results submitted by the IVA that have been confirmed by the World Bank as  achieved. No advances under the PforR component are envisaged. To mitigate the risk of delay in the transfer  of  funds  from the  FMFBNP  to  the  states  towards  achievement of  DLIs,  service  standards will  be established in the Operations Manual to ensure that states' share of funds received in the TSA at the federal level (by virtue of achievement of the DLIs) are transferred to the states' accounts within 14 days from the time of receipt of funds in the Special Fund Account.\n",
      "- 87. Audit. The annual audited financial statements of the SABER participating states, will constitute the basis for the fiduciary assurance required by the World Bank under the PforR. Annually, the PCU will submit to the World Bank, the audited financial statements of the participating states with state auditor's expression of audit opinion on the financial statements identifying program expenditures of the key MDAs. In addition, the PCU will compile data annually on recurrent expenditures for the relevant MDAs for the participating states from the audited financial statements. This will be certified by the Office of Auditor General of the Federation (OAuGF) and an opinion expressed. The annual states' audited financial statements shall be submitted to PCU for further submission to the World Bank within nine months of the end of fiscal year.\n",
      "- 88. Implementation of the IPF TA component (the 'Project') will be managed by the PCU housed in the FMFBNP HFD. The PCU will engage the NGF as a Project Management Firm to support the implementation and  management of the  TA  activities. The  Federal  Project  Financial  Management  Department  (FPFMD), established in the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF), will be responsible for managing the financial affairs of the Project along with the PCU. A Project Accountant and a Project Internal Auditor will be assigned to the PCU by the FPFMD, and they will be subject to clearance by the World Bank. Given the PCU's role with regards to financial management on the PforR component, an FM consultant may be hired, if needed.  This  consultant  will  be  funded  from  the  TA  and  will  be  hired  under  Terms  of  Reference  (TOR) acceptable to the World Bank.\n",
      "- 89. A Project Designated Account and a Naira draw down account will be opened and managed by the PCU along with FPFMD. Quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs) will be prepared for the Project by the Project Accountant to be submitted to the World Bank within 45 days from the end of the calendar quarter. Annual project financial statements will be prepared, and the annual audits will be conducted by the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation.

In line with the six core principles outlined in the World Bank's policy and guidance note for the PforR instrument, the relevant risks directly associated with the SABER Program activities and indirectly given the achievement of the program activities under the DLIs and within the proposed Result Areas (RAs) under the PforR covers environmental and social issues and include:\n",
      "- (a) Potential generation of e-waste given the digital data-centric and indexed database for CofOs.\n",
      "- (b) In  case  of  poor  implementation  of  FRILIA,  induced  increase  pollution  due  to  environmentally unsustainable agriculture practices.\n",
      "- (c) Indirectly,  temporary  displacement  of  people,  primarily  low-income  people  selling  their  wares  or residing along the right-of-way for the deployment of fiber optic network.\n",
      "- (d) Indirectly, the expansion and deployment of fiber optic networks given standardized ROW fees will lead to the generation of dust resulting in air pollution.\n",
      "- (e) Indirectly,  there  could  be  increase  in  carbon emissions due to use of off-grid diesel generators at cellular sites linked to fiber deployment.\n",
      "- (f) Indirectly, there may be gender-based violence (GBV) and sexual harassment (SH) due to the influx of workers deploying fiber optic networks.\n",
      "- (g) Indirectly, expected  environmental  and  social  risks, such  as risks due  to construction and rehabilitation and involuntary resettlement associated with PPP projects (that may materialize after Program completion), given weak E&amp;S systems in most states.\n",
      "- 91. The overall environmental and social risks have been assessed and deemed to be Moderate. Although the Program will not support construction work, the achievement of new ROW fees at maximally NGN145 per meter may indirectly lead to the expansion of fiber optic networks by the private sector (not financed by the Program), which will involve some minor construction which will not lead to displacement considering this will be limited to existing ROW. Also, the establishment of a robust PPP framework may indirectly lead to PPP projects involving construction and rehabilitation (after the Program period).  Actual Program activities are thus not likely to require significant changes to the Borrower's overall environmental and social systems. The Program  was  generally  assessed  as  moderate  because  some  improvements  in  environmental  and  social management approaches are expected through the Program despite the envisaged environmental and social risks outlined in the ESSA. Overall, the Program risks and impacts are likely not significant, not complex, low in magnitude, predictable and expected to be temporary and/or reversible; and there is low probability of serious  adverse  effects  to  human  health  and/or  the  environment  and  mitigation  measures  are  readily available, including use of exclusion list.\n",

      "- (c) There is a need to develop a standard procedure for consultation with all program-affected persons along the ROW (for DLI2).\n",
      "- (d) There is need to develop an effective Program-wide GRM system that aligns with state ADR system so complainants and businesses (especially small-scale businesses and those that do not have the capacity to use the courts) can leverage on for resolution of their concerns.\n",
      "- (e) There is a need to increase the capacity and effective framework to handle GBV, SH and SEA.\n",
      "- 93. Following  the  recommendations,  the  breakdown  of  actions  to  be  included  in  the  PAP are:  (1)  Hire qualified Environmental and Social Officers at the PCU and provide capacity building/system strengthening program to strengthen their skills; (2) Inclusion of E&amp;S considerations in PPP framework for participating states in DLI3; (3) Include in the Operational Manual, environmental and social guidelines for participating states' MDAs responsible for broadband deployment to explore core social inclusion activities such as gender, SEP, SEA/SH, and protection of the vulnerable groups including, OHS, GRM and stakeholder consultation procedure for PAPs, etc.; and (4) develop e-waste management strategy for managing e-waste result from the program.\n",
      "- 94. The  environmental  and  social  risk  of  the  IPF  component  is  rated  'Low'  as  the  TA  will  only  finance capacity building support to states to strengthen their system and capacity to enable them to deliver the DLIs, strengthen program coordination and engagement of an IVA. The environmental risk is rated Low. TA activities will not support or design any kind of physical intervention or civil work. The TA may require some office/IT equipment. The decision of goods procurement including limited office equipment, or IT is yet to be confirmed and will require prior World Bank clearance. The TA is expected to be available for all states to strengthen  the  capabilities  of  the  states  in  achieving  the  Program's  DLIs/DLRs  through  training,  template development, and learning support. The TA is expected to bring long term positive environmental impact through the achievement of sustainable DLIs. Any kind of activities triggering negative environmental and social risk/impact will not be supported by this TA. The TA will ensure the template developed for the DLIs include environmentally sustainable criteria, where applicable. The potential risks from the TA are expected to be minimal. The potential risks are: (i) Waste generation from the offices of the implementing agencies, rental  of  resource  inefficient  equipment  of  the  IPF  component;  (ii)  Poor  working  conditions  in  offices, occupational health and safety (OHS) and travel-related risks; (iii) Health issues due to the lack of COVID-19 Protocols during trainings supported by the project; and (iv) Lack of fire safety provision in the building. The Client will prepare an Environmental Social Management Plan (ESMP) that details how the waste including ewastes and OHS and fire safety related issues will be appropriately managed and guidelines on conducting meetings under COVID-19 constraints. The proposed social risk is rated as Low given that the anticipated risks and impacts of the IPF activities are minimal and localized due to the types of activities, nature, sensitivity, scale, borrower's capacity and scope of the project. The IPF component will only finance capacity building support to states to strengthen their system and capacity to enable them to deliver the DLIs, strengthen program  coordination  and  engagement  of  a  program  management  firm  and  an  IVA.  No  infrastructural activities will be financed under the IPF components. However, there could be potential risk of unfavorable working conditions; lack of adherence to national labor laws; and exclusion as a result of gender in terms of engagement and employment under the IVA. On the IVA engagement, appropriate E&amp;S performance will be included  as  part  of  the  activities  to  be  monitored  including  the  IVA  code  of  conduct  for  its  workers. Furthermore, the project will incorporate a system / mechanism to ensure citizens' involvement / engagement and active involvement of identified stakeholders in the project.

Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected as a result of a World Bank supported PforR operation, as defined by the applicable policy and procedures, may submit complaints to the existing program grievance mechanism or the Bank's Grievance Redress Service (GRS). The GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly reviewed in order to address pertinent concerns. Project affected communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the Bank's independent Accountability Mechanism (AM). The AM houses the Inspection Panel, which determines whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of Bank non-compliance with its policies and procedures, and the Dispute Resolution Service, which provides  communities  and  borrowers  with  the  opportunity to address complaints  through  dispute resolution. Complaints may be submitted at any time after concerns have been brought directly to the Bank's attention,  and  Bank  Management has been given an opportunity to respond.

General elections and several state governor elections are planned in 2023, and 2022 is already witnessing an uptick in political activities, with several key stakeholders positioning themselves. Political elections will likely slow down the pace of implementation of government programs, due to overall distractions. A significant change in the administration in one or more of the states following the elections may also lead to a period of reduced political commitments, or policy stance  changes.  While  the  impact  of  the  general  elections  is  difficult  to  fully  mitigate,  it  will  be  lowered through continuous engagement with the key stakeholders such as PEBEC or the NGF (both effective platforms for  policy  dialogue  with  states)  before  and  after  election  and  building  the  capacity  and  strengthening\n",

The business-enabling environment, and private sector development more broadly, is likely to remain high on the priority list of any incoming administration and elected officials, given the dire fiscal situation across states and the urgency to attract and retain private investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 100. Sector Strategies and Policies risk is rated  as Substantial .  While  the  SABER  Program  will  build  on successes of previous business-enabling reform programs at both the Federal and State level, the ambitious reforms included in the Program remain challenging and will require political capital and ownership. Without a strong champion backing the reform program, experience in Nigeria and globally has shown that reform implementation remains limited. This will be mitigated through healthy 'competition' driven by the Program, incentivizing states to achieve results, and the strong commitment from the government and its adoption of the SABER program at the highest levels. Further, stagnation or inaction by the government on key businessenabling  reforms  not  covered  by  the  Program  also  risk  reducing  the  overall  impact  on  the  business environment. In 2020, the Nigerian authorities adjusted electricity tariffs to more cost-reflective levels; cut nonessential spending and redirected resources to COVID-19 responses at both the federal and the state levels; and enhanced debt management and increased public-sector transparency, especially for oil and gas revenue flows. However, as of 2022, policy has returned to a business-as-usual stance and several critical reforms remain unfinished, in particular the elimination of the PMS subsidy, and the likelihood of key reforms not being finalized has increased with the upcoming elections. While these key unfinished reforms are not within the scope of the Program, they can be mitigated through other programs currently supporting them. Key  analytical  work  by  the  World  Bank  is  combining  regular  assessments  of  macro-micro  dynamics  (e.g., Nigeria  Development  Update  (NDU),  Public  Finance  Review,  Country  Economic  Memorandum,  modular poverty assessment briefs), with in-depth analytics on trade, oil sector governance, financial sector stability, and distributional impacts of policy. The World Bank is also providing medium-term technical assistance on macroeconomic modeling, banking supervision, and data systems and processes to support more evidencebased  policymaking.  Lastly,  as  a  mitigating  factor,  the  platform  supported  by  SABER  to  coordinate  and implement  business-enabling  reforms  at  the  state  level  has  the  potential  to  also  become  an  advocating platform for key federal-level reforms.\n",
      "- 101. Technical Design of the Program risk is rated as Substantial . The government program supported by the  SABER  Program  is  strategically  relevant  and  technically  sound.  Where  there  are  shortcomings  in  the government program, the Program's technical design and implementation arrangements will aim to address them. The Program technical design and implementation arrangements have been informed by previous PforRs  with  similar  design  (SFTAS),  similar  technical  content  (KDSET),  analytical  work  by  the  Bank,  the expertise  of  PEBEC-EBES,  the  FMFBNP's  HFD  and  NGF,  and  inputs  from  consultations  with  states  (state commissioners  of  finance,  budget  and  planning,  and  state  MDAs)  who  will  be  directly  involved  in implementing the Program. However, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty from the Program working across multiple (potentially all 36 states and FCT) and a diverse set of states in terms of starting point and capabilities. This will be mitigated through: (1) consultative process through the preparation process; (2) the design of the Program (a common DLI matrix designed to account for the heterogeneity across states); (3) the TA support under the IPF component help to mitigate the risks of working across multiple states; and (4) recognizing that amendments of the verification protocol and Program restructuring are an inherent part of Program implementation.\n",

      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "- 102. Institutional  Capacity  for  Implementation  and  Sustainability  risk  is  rated  as  High. As  a  form  of continuation to the SFTAS Program, the SABER Program will benefit from having HFD as the anchor PCU coordinating the Program. HFD has developed solid competencies in World Bank policies and processes, the PforR instrument, and staff with the organizational knowledge to coordinate a multi-state PforR. As such, at the  federal  level  the  institutional  risk is considered  substantial.    However,  at  the  state  level,  the implementation of the Program can be affected by the weak capacity of implementing MDAs, the high number of key MDAs associated with the Program, six in each state (compared to SFTAS, which involved fewer MDAs in each state), the multi-sectoral nature of business-enabling reforms (requiring these six MDAs to coordinate with dozens of other MDAs and with the private sector), and the lack of previous experience these state MDAs have with a performance-based disbursement environment. To mitigate this risk, the IPF component of SABER will provide  key technical assistance and  capacity building to business-enabling MDAs  to  support implementation, and peer-learning activities will be supported to enhance knowledge transfer between states that are more advanced on their business enabling reforms, and lower capacity states. Another mitigating measure is the establishment of State Steering Councils (often called EODB Councils) at the state level, which are already in place in 17 states. Thus, while the level of implementation risk at the federal level is substantial, the implementation risk at the state level is high and this justifies an aggregate implementation risk rating of high.\n",
      "- 103. The overall Program integrated residual fiduciary risk (FM, procurement, and governance) is rated Substantial. The IFSA shows that the PCU and states have the capabilities to provide reasonable assurance that  the  financing  proceeds  will  be  used  for  intended  purposes  with  the  objective  of  supporting  the achievement of the Program objectives. However, the assessment found that there are some weaknesses and risks in the overall fiduciary systems of the Program, necessitating action plans to mitigate them. The key fiduciary risks are the following: (1) risk of delay in transfer of Program funds to the participating states; (2) weak internal controls over public expenditures in general, also leading to risk of inflated payroll and ghost workers in less than 25 percent of states that have committed to (through the SFTAS Charter, signed August 17, 2022), but have not yet strengthened payroll management and management of ghost workers; and (3) weaknesses in compliance with the established legal and institutional framework for combating fraud and corruption at the Program level, which could undermine the ability of the authorities to detect and address the occurrence of fraud and corruption risk in a timely and effective manner. These risks will be mitigated progressively through the implementation of the PAP.\n",

Nigeria must catalyze private investment to achieve a robust recovery; this will continue to be a priority in the medium term as fiscal conditions at the state level will remain challenging. Between 2016 and 2019, while Africa's share of global FDI inflows grew from 2.2 percent to 3.2 percent, Nigeria's share of FDI inflows to Africa declined from 7.5 percent to 4.9 percent.  Attracting and retaining private investment could drive increased job creation, revenue diversification, and sustainable growth, making it a key priority for Nigeria. The current fiscal pressures faced by the country have further underlined how crowding in private investment at scale is imperative to achieve Nigeria's development priorities.\n",
      "- 2. Given the urgency of these reforms, the government is developing a new program-State Action on Business Enabling Reforms (SABER)-to accelerate the implementation of critical actions that improve the business  enabling  environment  in  Nigeria's  states .  The  government's  SABER  program  will  build  on  the successes of PEBEC.  It will prioritize targeted business-enabling environment reform actions at the state level. It aims to strengthen the existing PEBEC subnational interventions by adding incentives, namely results-based financing to the states, and the delivery of wholesale technical assistance-available to all states-to support gaps in reform implementation.\n",

The success of the Program will not be affected by the implementation of the areas of the government SABER program not included in the Program.\n",

The CPF reflects Nigeria's aspiration for faster, more inclusive, and sustained economic growth in the next decade to help the government in its aspiration to lift 100 million people out of poverty. This Program directly supports the CPF's pillar of 'promoting jobs and economic transformation and diversification' and the related complementary priority of furthering business enabling reforms and promoting competitive clusters. It would also contribute to the related core objectives of increased access to reliable and sustainable power for households and firms and the development of digital infrastructure, platforms, and skills. 58\n",

A complex registration process contributes to most transactions taking place in the informal market. Except for in the South East, it takes on average between 1 and 3 months to obtain a CofO in Nigeria. As a result, an estimated 70 percent of transactions take place in the informal market. The lack of data affects states' ability to  implement  basic  social  and  economic  planning,  discouraging  investment  and  limiting  the  collection  of property tax.

Customary practices coexist with statutory land laws, resulting in conflicting land administration frameworks. As a result, there are several challenges and risks in the operationalization of current laws and processes, which can impact land-based private investment. These include how: (a) documentation and spatial information concerning existing rights are weak, especially in rural areas; (b) land allocation decisions based on the principle that the Government owns all land sometimes fails to take into account the legal and constitutional recognition of customary uses of rural communities; (c) the legal status of common areas is uncertain, despite the fact that such areas are critical  for  livelihoods  of  rural  communities;  (d)  compulsory  acquisition  processes  and  compensation standards are at times not consistent with international best practice; (e) excessive reliance on compulsory acquisition to assemble land for private investment may limit the potential involvement of local communities as genuine partners in an investment; (f) benefit arrangements may be vaguely defined and constrained by weak community capacity to negotiate; (g) there is weak capacity in the state government to conduct land acquisition and reallocation efficiently and fairly; and (h) government identification of land for large-scale investment is not always based on robust environmental and social impact assessments. 62\n",

Even in the absence of legal reform, some states have piloted innovative approaches that conform with international standards and good practices for responsible and inclusive land-based investments .  Jigawa adopted the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) in April 2018. LARF was a substantial step towards ensuring responsible investments by emphasizing the state acquisition of land with full compensation and resettlement requirements. However, it left room for improvement, particularly related to the absence of  inclusive  investment  provisions. 66 Following  Jigawa's  experience,  Kaduna,  with  World  Bank  support, adopted the Framework for Responsible and Inclusive Land-Intensive Agriculture (FRILIA) 67 with the objective of attracting investments in agriculture that are inclusive and ensure shared benefits among investors and the communities living in and around the sites of investments. FRILIA consists of multiple principles related to land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental and social sustainability. The principles are derived from two  internationally  negotiated  agreements  on  responsible  land-based  investments:  (1)  the  Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries, and Forests in the Context of National Food Security; and (2) the United Nations Committee on World Food Security's Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems.\n",

However, the adoption and implementation of FRILIA over the course of the Program will play an important role in mitigating such risks. By its very nature, FRILIA  incorporates  and  ensures  the  application  of  sound  principles  related  to  land  acquisition  and resettlement as well as environmental and social sustainability. In addition, there are potential operational risks related to procurement of resources for the automation of CofO databases, sustainability of the created systems over time, and lack of adoption of the new systems by public officials and users.

Given  broadband's  potential  to  improve productivity  and  enable  new  ventures,  studies  find  that  a  10  percent  increase  in  mobile  broadband penetration is associated with up to 2.5 percent of additional GDP growth per annum in Africa.  Recognizing broadband's importance, Nigeria's National Broadband Plan (NBP) 2020-2025 targets a 70 percent broadband penetration rate for the population over 15 years old, 90 percent 4G/5G population coverage, and 60 percent digital literacy by 2025. The challenge of meeting these objectives is substantial: Only about 23 percent of Nigerians use broadband services, and companies commonly cite lack of reliable broadband access as a key constraint.    Relatedly,  Nigeria  currently  needs  between  120,000  to  167,000  km  of  fiber  infrastructure  in addition to its current 55,000 km to reach NBP targets. At the state level, fiber deployment has been held back by excessive, untransparent, and inconsistent ROW fees, amongst other state levies.\n",

By targeting state-level legal reforms to standardize and lower ROW and other per-meter fees (to a maximum  of  NGN145  per  meter)  and  streamline  related  processes,  the  PforR  is  expected  to  lead  to significant increased fiber deployment . According to the latest data gathered from States, only 10 of Nigeria's States are applying aggregate per-meter fees of at most 145NGN/meter for ROW and related fees such as reinstatement (Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Imo, and Kebbi). Relatedly, it has been reported by private operators that some of States have restructured the reduced ROW fees into new administrative or reinstatement fees, thereby lessening the positive impact of the fee reductions.

      "The World Bank the states, only Lagos-which charges above 145NGN/meter-has a website clearly outlining fees, processes, MDAs, and MDAs' contact information for obtaining approval to lay fiber, and no states have a portal showing all approved ROW applications (i.e., list of applicants, locations, and fees paid). Thus, the fee reduction reforms targeted  by  the  Program  have  the  potential  to  significantly  lower  unit  deployment  costs  and  therefore increase deployment: If aggregate per-meter fees charged by all states were to be reduced to the targeted level, the cost of dark fiber deployment to reach NBP targets would decline from US$3.4 billion to US$1 billion as  the  ROW  portion  of  the  cost  would  drop  from  US$2.5  billion  to  US$150  million.    Relatedly,  the  PforR stipulates  that  states  should  standardize  and  publish  processes  (including  specifying  all  relevant  MDAs, procedures, and timelines) for applying for and obtaining ROW and publish approved ROW going forward in order to reduce administrative discretion and uncertainty and increase transparency.\n",

      "20. States face policy risks related to achieving fiber deployment targets as set forth in the PforR. At the state  level,  there  is  a  risk  of  states  lowering  ROW  fees  but  offsetting  these  decreases  with  new  levies elsewhere.  To mitigate this  risk,  the  PforR  stipulates  that  states  should  adopt  legal  instruments  that  cap aggregate per-linear-meter fees rather than just specifying a decrease in ROW fees per se. At the national level, risks related to ineffective wholesale regulatory frameworks by Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), continued failure to impose obligations on dominant operators to provide reference access offers for wholesale  infrastructure  access,  and  inadequate  demand  in  poorer,  less  dense  areas  may  also  hold  back deployment. To mitigate this risk, the WBG is working in parallel with the NCC and other Nigerian government stakeholders to streamline the wholesale licensing framework and support the finalization of a cost model for determining  wholesale  reference  access  offers.  Finally,  ROW  and  other  levies  at  the  state  level-and information on who charges the fees-are often opaque, hindering measurement for PforR purposes and creating  uncertainty  amongst  operators.  To  manage  this  risk,  the  DLI  aims  to  increase  transparency  on relevant fees and levies from states.\n",

Nigeria's National Development Plan (NDP) (2021-2025) estimates that the attainment of the NDP will require an investment commitment of about N348.1 trillion. The capital expenditure to be funded by the government during the period is to be NGN49.7 trillion (14.3 percent) while the balance of NGN298.3 trillion (85.7 percent) is expected from the private sector. Of the 14.3 percent government contribution, FGN's capital expenditure will be NGN29.6 trillion (8.5 percent), while the Sub-National Governments' capital expenditure is estimated to be about NGN20.1 trillion (5.8 percent). The successful implementation of this Plan heavily depends on a solid partnership between the private and public sector. The government has identified PPPs as a key financing option to be deployed more systematically for financing its ambitious plan. While the target is aggressive, it highlights the importance of PPPs for the government and for each state. Many states have also recognized PPPs as a financing option for their infrastructure stock, as demonstrated by the passage of PPP laws across 20 states including the FCT. However, several of these laws require strengthening and institutionalization. The proposed activities of the PforR will support the development of PPP frameworks to align them with prevailing best practice frameworks that ensure that specific PPP roadblocks are addressed.\n",

      "- 22. PPPs require large upfront capital investments and government fiscal commitments. In addition, they need to be well prepared with appropriate risk allocation to be attractive to private investors and generate sufficient competition for price discovery. Projects need to be analyzed from different perspectives, namely, technical, economic, financial, fiscal, legal, environmental (including climate impacts) and social. The skills required  for  these  extensive  analyses  are  not  available  within  governments  and  the  support  of  external advisors  and  specialists  working  in  cohesive  and  collaborative  teams  is  essential.  Consequently,  project development costs are substantial, 68 and the duration from project identification and feasibility assessment to financial close can be long with some variation based on context. Constant follow-up and engagement on the part of government is essential throughout the process of preparation and financial close, with the need for dedicated and specialist government personnel. Project preparation is, therefore, a complex skill driven activity which involves substantial resources, and extensive assessments and documentation to ensure that the project is viable and bankable, i.e., generates the interest of both lenders and equity providers.\n",
      "- 23. In Nigeria, contracting authorities within states have a limited skillset and face budgetary constraints. In addition, project preparation goes beyond a single year, so amounts for the continuing work on the same projects frequently need to be budgeted annually year on year leading to high levels of budgetary uncertainty due to  competing  fiscal  needs  and  fiscal  constraints,  and  consequent  time  lags  in  the  process  of  project preparation. Globally, to  circumvent these constraints and to provide a sustainable source of funding for project preparation, countries have created project preparation facilities, for example, Indonesia, Philippines, Brazil, Mexico, India, South Africa, Kenya etc. highlighting the case for dedicated project development funds to support countries to source specialist skills on an ongoing basis for generating a stable pipeline of wellprepared  projects.  Apart  from  performing  the  function  of  funding  project  preparation  and  transaction advisory  support,  project  development  funds  can  finance  upstream  studies  and  assessments  as  well  as downstream activities to facilitate financial closure of projects through providing additional instruments and mechanisms  such  as  viability  gap  financing  and  liquidity  reserves.  Project  development  funds  indicate government commitment to its PPP program and help in adopting good practices in PPP preparation and roll out. Project development funds can also be structured to leverage climate financing through adopting climate mitigation and resilience standards and disclosure standards (based on international standards such as those recommended by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) as part of their governance and operations frameworks.\n",

Experience related to supporting PPP enabling frameworks shows that spikes in PPP activity frequently occur following the passage of basic enabling legislation , including sector-specific legislation which enables a  specific  project  or  batch  or  projects  to  be  implemented  in  a  single  sector.  For  example,  South  Korea registered PPP investment growth of KRW98 trillion (approximately US$83 billion) over the 2005-2019 period following the establishment of a PPP legal framework. While Nigeria implemented a large ports concessions program via a sectoral law in 2006 which unlocked the concession of 25 terminals and several greenfield PPP projects across the country.

However, a range of objectives beyond the identification of projects to implement in the near term may still merit conducting such exercises. Although a primary objective will always be the identification of PPP projects to be implemented in the near term, other highly relevant objectives for building PPP institutions include developing the practical capacity to identify suitable PPP projects; building institutional relationships across government; developing processes and procedures for project identification and screening; assessing PPP program potential, including identifying high priority sectors and likely funding and financing requirements; and removing projects which are unlikely to be successful in order avoid wasting scarce project preparation resources.

In fact, research shows that this impact is more pronounced in less-developed jurisdictions, likely pointing to the role of subnational IPAs in helping investors address  information  gaps,  inadequate  transparency,  and  weaker  institutional  conditions. 71 Compared to national IPAs, subnational IPAs require deeper knowledge of the local business environment and its value proposition to investors and stronger ties to local agencies involved in the day-to-day operational issues  facing  investors.  Approximately  12  Nigerian  states  now  have  an  IPA  responsible  for  designing  and implementing strategies  to  attract,  retain  and  service  investors  in  the  state,  but  only  a  few  of  these  are adequately resourced and have demonstrated the capacity to attract large-scale investments and FDI into their states. Other states either lack IPAs or IPAs with insufficient mandate. The performance of existing State IPAs  is  impeded  by  lack  of  a  corporate  plan  or  strategy,  dedicated  staff  and  financial  resources,  internal organizational tools (such as investment tracking and information systems), clearly articulated performance indicators, and poor service delivery. 18\n",

Although the use of investment incentives is widespread across countries, they generally play a limited role in investor-decision making. However, they can be effective under specific conditions when the overall policy environment and investment climate is conducive. 72 Thus, where countries grant investment incentives, it is important to ensure the cost-effectiveness of the incentives granted and transparency on their availability and administration. In Nigeria, incentives are offered at the federal and state levels.  The  Nigerian  Investment Promotion Commission, in collaboration with the Federal Inland Revenue Service, published the Compendium on Investment Incentives in 2017, primarily covering incentives at the federal level. While dated, this compendium provides an overview of some of the main incentives available to investors. Currently, no states publish similar standardized, updated information on the available federal and state incentives or number of recipients of incentives. Relatedly, the structures for collecting and coordinating investment information and ensuring its effective dissemination to potential and active investors are weak. Ensuring easier access to such information is key for investors to benefit from the business environment, and for state governments to prevent corruption, political quid-pro-quo, and inefficiency. By incentivizing states to publish inventories on investment incentives (Federal and State) available to investors as well as on the number of recipients of those incentives, this DLI aims to bring about greater transparency in the business environment.\n",

Political instability, absence of support from the highest level of government, insufficient allocation of financial resources, staff turnover, crowding in of functions, and political-economy challenges are some key risks that could impede states in achieving their desired outcomes under this DLI .

NIPC continues to have a crowded mandate, covering receiving business  delegations,  administration  of  the  pioneer  status  incentive  (PSI)  regime,  operating  a  'one-stop investment center' (OSIC), media/public outreach, project identification for investment, review of investment laws and bilateral treaties, outreach to potential domestic investors, and certification of subnational IPAs.\n",

Transparency  and  easier  access  to  information  on  government  processes  for  licenses  and  permits contributes to the reduction of information asymmetries which can mitigate corruption and rent seeking . One of the key reasons for official state website is to aid the access to high-quality, relevant, and accurate information that shapes business planning. Many researchers have found positive relationships between the use of e-government and improved transparency, accountability, and political trust. 73 Studies  have  found evidence  that  citizen  satisfaction  with  transparency  and  accountability  in  government  websites  increases confidence  in  government  policies  and  actions. 74 Transparency  is  also  strongly  associated  with  higher investment: 75 By  reducing  the  need  for  personal  connections  to  local  elites  and  having  clear  rules  and processes,  it  encourages  more  widespread  investment,  especially  by  those  that  lack  those  personal connections.  As  countries  increase  the  degree  of  transparency  in  their  economy,  their  attractiveness  to foreign investment increases: A one-point increase in their transparency ranking increases FDI flows by 40 percent. 76 At the Federal level, Executive Order 001 issued by the president in 2017 instructed every MDA of the FGN to publish a complete list of all requirements or conditions for obtaining products and services within the MDA's scope of responsibility. 77\n",

      "- 33. Strengthening  domestic  and  external  trade  competitiveness-especially  at  the  state  level-will  be crucial for Nigeria to maximize the gains from the AfCFTA . The AfCFTA agreement will create the largest free trade area in the world measured by the number of countries participating. The pact connects 1.3 billion people across 55 countries with a combined GDP valued at US$3.4 trillion. It has the potential to lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty, but achieving its full potential will depend on putting in place significant policy reforms and trade facilitation measures. Nigeria operates a federal system with a constitution that clearly defines the role of the federal, state, and local governments. Although trade-related reforms are within the ambit of the federal government, the states have a critical role to play if the gains from the AfCFTA are to be maximized.  Most  export-oriented  firms  are  located  in  the  states,  so  boosting  subnational  domestic  and external trade competitiveness is imperative.  Ample evidence suggests that greater AfCFTA gains would come from lowering trade barriers by reducing non-tariff barriers and supporting export promotion activities 78 . In a 2013 study on the Lagos-Kano-Jibiya (LAKAJI) corridor, it was reported that approximately 40 percent of the cost to export could be linked to inefficiencies and informal payments across this road corridor. Furthermore, informal cost represented about 3 percent of the total cost to import or US$162 per 20-foot container with the majority incurred during border clearance and transport from Lagos warehouses to Kano. The informal cost from Kano to Jibiya was lower in absolute terms (US$32) but is higher in relative terms and is reported to be positively correlated with the number of checkpoints on this stretch of the corridor. 79 State level actions\n",

Competitive business environments  boost  productivity  and  investment 80 ,  so  transparency  around  trade  fees  and  actions  that support export promotion could help maximize the gains from the AfCFTA. The DLI supports these objectives at the sub-national level though States (i) publishing fees on an official state website; (ii) establishing/strengthening GRMs to record and resolve incidents of unofficial fees and checkpoints, and other practices that impede interstate trade flows; and (iii) building capacity for export promotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 34. Several risks may prevent states from achieving the full intended impact of the GRM system to combat illegal fees and security checkpoints, as well as to conduct proper state-level export promotion activities. First, trade policy formulation remains at the federal level and requires a high level of political support to ensure implementation of the AfCFTA and regional integration; trade restrictions imposed at the federal level remain a major challenge to achieving this DLI. The restrictive trade policy environment makes it difficult for domestic companies to access high-quality inputs from abroad and the technologies they need to improve their productivity and competitiveness and take advantage of international markets. Such trade restrictions can thus pose a challenge to achieving the PforR's development objectives even if state export promotion activities are put into place as they hamper exporters' competitiveness. Second, when states will push for the elimination of haulage fees, it could hurt some interests and generate opposition. States will need to consult with stakeholders to limit the risk of vested interests delaying reforms. Finally, the inadequate allocation of funding, weak mandates, and limited capacity of the SCEPs pose a major challenge to export promotion at the state level. Relatedly, NEPC has desk officers at the state level and is currently the only SCEP member that contributes financially. The lack of trained personnel is also a challenge at the state level, as export promotion requires a specific set of skills and knowledge that remains scarce or requires training.\n",

The regimes of presumptive taxation for micro and small businesses in several states are complex and difficult to comply with, multiple layers of taxation cause challenges for firms, and most payment systems do not use modern technological solutions and are inefficient . In several states, the presumptive tax regimes are very complex, with a large number of business categories and different rates for micro, small, medium firms within each category. For example, in Kaduna there are 40 business categories specified along with fixed rates  for  each,  resulting  in  120  different  rates.  Several  policy  and  implementation  issues  arise  from  this situation, including unclear definitions of micro, small, medium firms; unclear basis of determination of fixed and lump-sum rates; businesses paying the same fixed fee, even in bad years of operation; regressive fixed rates; overlapping business categories leading to discretion by tax officials that could encourage rent-seeking behavior; and fixed rates that are not indexed to inflation, meaning declining tax revenues in real terms given high inflation in Nigeria of between 16-18 percent on average.\n",

In several states, even after payments are made to government, taxpayers are often required to resubmit receipts to the agencies before further action is taken.

This would increase compliance and reduce time spent on paying taxes.\n",

      "- 38. Some state and market actors may pose a challenge to the implementation of a turnover based rate . States often use current fixed rates because of difficulties in finding out firms' turnover. While mandating a consolidated demand notice is possible at the State level (many states already issue a consolidated demand notice), it may be far more difficult to convince Local Governments to buy into a consolidated demand notice. However, most Local Governments have agreed to a consolidated demand notice for land charges such that state property taxes and ground rents are consolidated with tenement rates into a Land Use Charge with a sharing formula for sharing collections.\n",

The State Revenue Laws developed to meet SFTAS DLI 4.1 provided that all state revenue sources along with their rates be approved by the State House of Assembly along with the sources and rates applicable for the local authorities of the state. In many, but not all cases, States put in provisions for the state authorities to collect on behalf of the local authorities some of their revenues such as tenement rates and some larger market rates.

According to the January 2021 PEBEC Ease of Doing Business Subnational Survey, only 8 percent of surveyed SMEs had utilized the judicial system to enforce a breach of law, and when they do, businesses spent an average of 6.3 percent of their revenue on court costs. The low utilization of courts may be attributed to the relatively high costs and complexity of the judicial process and the overall difficulty in gaining access to justice. According to the Subnational Doing Business Survey 2018, resolving a commercial dispute across Nigerian states takes 475 days and costs 37 percent of the claim value, on average. In  addition,  the  time  taken  to  receive  justice  for  commercial  disputes  negatively  affects  businesses  and potential litigants across Nigeria, resulting in reduced investments.  Small claims constitute the bulk of the court caseload in many countries. They absorb a significant and at times disproportionate share of valuable system  resources.  Effective  small  claims  procedures  can  free  up  such  resources  to  be  redirected  to  the effective resolution of more challenging case-types.

The  most  common problems in implementation are the need for training and lack of readiness in the organization.

      "- 50. Rationale for public provision and financing .  The proposed Program is designed to support reforms that are within government control and public services that will not otherwise be provided by the private sector. The benefits are for all of the private sector.  For instance, business-enabling regulatory reforms are greatly within  the  purview  of  state  authorities.  In  addition,  the  public  nature  of  improving  the  institutional frameworks  for  tax  administration,  land  registration  and  acquisition,  and  resettlement  justify  public intervention. The application of international best practices in implementing government reforms promotes efficiency and growth.\n",
      "- 51. The  proposed  Program  addresses  coordination  and  information  asymmetry  market  failures  that constraint  private  sector  growth .  Public  support  to  strengthen  investment  promotion/retention  and  the development of PPP legal frameworks are justified as they address coordination failures by leveraging the capacity of the government to coordinate economic agents' interactions and investments in targeted sectors through regulation and promotion activities.\n",
      "- 52. The  support  to  improve  transparency  across  state-level  MDAs  involved  in  providing  services  to,  or regulating, the private sector is justified due to existing information asymmetries that disproportionately hurt smaller firms and other vulnerable groups such as women . Investing in platforms and mechanisms to make  service-  and  regulation-related  information  publicly  available  will  increase  the  transparency  and credibility  of  state-level  MDA  services.    Addressing  the  information  gaps  will  enhance  the  efficiency  and benefit both the public and private sectors.\n",
      "- 53. Program's economic impact . The net present value of project is positive and significant. The aim of the project is to improve the business enabling environments by having several states opt in to undertake a series of reforms. These reforms would be targeted at improving the regulatory and legal environment for firms to enter  and  operate,  improve  transparency  of  and  access  to  information  for  firms  regarding  procedures, streamline  taxes,  and  providing  a  better  regulatory  framework  for  private  investment  in  fiber  optic infrastructure.

This  research  is complemented by Nigerian macroeconomic data to calculate the estimated benefits. Costs of the project are taken  from  the  World  Bank's  program  costs  and  the  program  expenditure  framework.  Using  the  most conservative estimates (specified above), the net present value of the project calculated at a discount rate of 13 percent over the three-year period is estimated at US$542 billion (Table 10).\n",

      "\n",
      "- 1. The  Integrated  Fiduciary  Systems  Assessment  (IFSA)  assessed  the  fiduciary  systems  of  all  key implementing agencies in the states (and FCT) and their recurrent expenditures that are part of the Program Expenditure Framework (PEF) that the SABER PforR Program will support .  It  was carried out relying on a sample of six representative states, consistent with World Bank Policy PforR Financing (November 2017), World Bank Directive on PforR Financing (July 2019) and in line with relevant guidelines. 90\n",
      "- 2. The  objective  of  the  assessment  was  to  examine  whether  Program  systems  provide  reasonable assurance that the financing proceeds will be used for their intended purposes, with due attention to the principles of economy, efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and accountability . The financial management (FM) systems were assessed to gauge the extent to which the planning, budgeting, accounting, controls,  funds  flow,  financial  reporting,  and  auditing  systems  and  practices  can  provide  a  reasonable assurance on the appropriate use of Program funds and safeguarding of its assets. The Program procurement systems have also been assessed to establish the extent to which the planning, bidding, evaluation, contract award, and contract administration arrangements and practices provide a reasonable assurance in support of achievement  of  the  Program  results.  In  addition,  the  assessment  considered  how  Program  governance systems manage the risks of fraud and corruption and how such risks will be mitigated. The IFSA is focused on the  Program-for-Results  component,  while  Annex  8  defines  the  FM,  disbursement,  and  procurement arrangements for the IPF component for TA of the SABER Operation.\n",
      "- 3. Conclusion and Fiduciary Risk Rating .  The  conclusion of the assessment is that the fiduciary systems, capacity and performance of the PCU and the key implementing agencies in the states (and FCT), relying on a representative sample of states (Abia, Edo, Enugu, Gombe, Kaduna and Nasarawa), combined with the results of  the  fiduciary  assessments  carried  out  under  SFTAS  and  CARES,  are  adequate  to  provide  reasonable assurance  that  the  Program  funds  will  be  used  for  the  intended  purposes  in  an  effective,  efficient  and transparent manner subject to the implementation of a set of risk mitigation measures. The overall Program integrated fiduciary risk (FM, procurement, and governance) is rated High , and the residual fiduciary risk is rated Substantial .  The IFSA has identified risks for which mitigation measures are proposed; these will be managed through implementation of the PAP.\n",
      "- 4. Reasonable  assurance. The  fiduciary  systems,  institutions,  and  practices  of  the  representative  states combined with the results of the fiduciary assessments carried out under SFTAS and CARES provide reasonable assurance that Program resources will be used for the intended purposes and will support the achievement of Program objectives in an effective, efficient, and transparent manner - subject to full implementation of the PAP.\n",
      "- 5. Risk assessment. The key fiduciary risks are the following: (i) risk of delay in transfer of Program funds to the participating states; (ii) weak internal controls over public expenditures in general, and specifically leading to risk of inflated payroll and ghost workers in less than 25 percent of states that have committed to (through\n",

      "\n",
      "- 6. Mitigation measures. The mitigation measures for the above stated risks will be:\n",
      "- (a) To ensure timely transfer of Program funds to the states against achieved DLIs, service standards will be established and documented in the Operations Manual, for funds to be transferred within 14 days of receipt of Program funds into the Special Fund Account held with the CBN at the federal level. This will be monitored during Program supervision.\n",
      "- (b) The risk of inflated payroll and ghost workers has largely been addressed through SFTAS' DLI 5 for strengthened payroll management and management of ghost workers. This DLI was one of the highest achieving with more than 75 percent of the states achieving it. In addition, all States committed on August 17, 2022, through the SFTAS Charter, to sustain the SFTAS reforms achieved in the states, and to participate in annual SFTAS assessments and scorecards. Hence, results from SFTAS will continue to be monitored, and are relevant for SABER. Regarding weaknesses in internal control over public expenditures in general, annual audits will also be conducted in the 36 states of the state accounts. For the participating states, audited financial statements (AFS), prepared in accordance with IPSAS, are part of the Eligibility Criteria of the Program. The AFS will be used to extract expenditures relating to the overall Program in line with the PEF for the participating states. This information will be collated and consolidated by the PCU on an annual basis.\n",
      "- (c) To mitigate the risk of fraud and corruption, a signed submission from the PCU/ HFD shall be made every six months as part of the semi-annual progress reports using a template agreed with the World Bank.  The  states  will  submit  information  to  the  PCU,  thereafter  the  PCU  will  consolidate  for submission to the Bank. This submission shall provide details of any allegations or complaints on fraud and corruption regarding any part of the Program implementation, including status of actions taken. Even  where  there  are  no  allegations  or  complaints  during  a  reporting  period,  positive  assurance should be provided to the World Bank of this status.\n",

      "- 8. Scope. The IFSA covered the federal PCU and all states (and FCT), relying on six representative states (Abia, Edo, Enugu, Gombe, Kaduna and Nasarawa). The IFSA was conducted through review of the systems and practices of six representative states, combined with information/ systems reviewed as part of the countrywide SFTAS and CARES programs' fiduciary assessments. Review of fiduciary systems of the key implementing agencies in the six representative states was also carried out. Ongoing SFTAS results were reviewed, and SFTAS Charter implementation will continue to be reviewed for PFM indicators. The World Bank has been supporting and continues to support state governments in strengthening their service delivery and institutional and FM systems  and  processes  through  several  operations.  Subnational  IFSAs  will  not  be  required  for  state participation, rather participation of states will be dependent on meeting the eligibility criteria.\n",

The  PEF  is  based  on  the  recurring  expenditures  of  key implementing agencies in all 36 states for the years 2022 to 2025, estimated at US$2.0 billion. It amounts to the  total  recurrent  operating  expenses  (personnel  and  overhead)  of  the  agencies  responsible  for  the achievement of the PforR objectives (Table 8). The IDA contribution to PEF amounts to US$730 million (36 percent of overall program expenditures).\n",

The recurrent expenditures (personnel and overhead) will be the basis of analysis for ensuring that the overall  program  expenditures  (actual)  at  program  closure  are  more  than  or  equal  to  the  Program withdrawals from IDA . During the program implementation, states will submit their annual audited financial statements, which will contain details of the recurrent spending of the states, broken down by individual ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs), allowing for identification of the recurrent spending by the relevant MDAs and the computation of overall program expenditures.  This information will be collated and consolidated by the PCU on an annual basis, as well as at the end of the Program.\n",

The  existing  systems  of  budgetary  planning  &amp;  preparation,  budget execution,  accounting,  internal  controls,  funds  flow,  financial  reporting,  external  audit,  and  legislative oversight will continue to be adopted for Program implementation. State Auditors-General are in place in all sub-national governments and are performing regular external audit. On the Program Procurement Systems, the Program expenditures are essentially recurrent in nature and will not include large value and high-risk procurement items. It may however include procurement items like office and computer consumables, minor office maintenance, vehicle maintenance and repairs, security services, and cleaning services.\n",
      "- a) Institutional and Legal Framework\n",
      "- 12. The key institution for PFM in the states is the State Ministries of Finance and its respective agencies. Other players include the State Ministry of Budget and Planning, the State National Assembly and the Office of the Auditor General. In general, the States' Accountant-Generals as well as the budget directorates play a significant  part  in  the  overall  management  and  control  of  public  finances  -  releasing  the  budget  and accounting for and reporting on the use of budgetary resources.  In Nigeria, broadly, the enabling institutional and  legal  framework  for  FM  is  contained  in  (a)  the  Constitution  (Sections  80-89)  -  accounts,  audit,  and investigations; (b) the Finance (Control &amp; Management) Act 1958 - the organic public finance management law; (c) the Fiscal Responsibility Act  2007, aiming to instil discipline into fiscal planning and management; (d) the  federal Public  Procurement Act 2007, and Public Procurement Acts at the state-level that mirror the federal Public Procurement Act - regulating public procurement for Federal and States' governments; (e) Audit Act 1957; and (f) Freedom of Information Act 2011 - aiming to improve transparency and public accountability by  providing  for  public  access  to  100  non-sensitive  official  data.  Along  with  the  subsidiary  legislations, regulations, and operational and financial directives which dictate the day-to-day basis for the management and oversight of public finances (notwithstanding the long overdue organic public finance legislation and the audit law), it is concluded that the legal framework is in place and acceptable to the World Bank.\n",

The  government  has  also  prepared  relevant implementation tools, including Regulations, Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) and Manuals.  In addition, a procurement professional cadre has been created at the federal level and in some states.  A complaints and appeals  mechanism  has  been  established  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Act  to  enhance transparency and accountability. The gains of the procurement reform at the federal level have extended to the 36 States of the Federation of Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 14. At the state-level, procurement laws have been enacted in 24 states while the remaining states have draft bills at various stages of consideration; procurement regulatory agencies have been established. Many states  have  deployed  e-Procurement  systems  in  a  minimum  of  four  high  spending  MDAs  include  works, education, and health, while Kaduna State has deployed the e-Procurement systems in twenty MDAs. This was achieved under the SFTAS PforR Program.\n",
      "- 15. Notwithstanding the above successes, there are still inherent weaknesses in the public procurement in the states. (i) The e-Procurement systems should be expanded to include all agencies being funded from the state budgets to increase the adoption of the e-Procurement system; (ii) it will be necessary to use the system for all procurable items including the small value, low-cost procurable items. This will promote transparency and efficiency of the procurement systems of the states; and (iii) not all the states have deployed the eProcurement system.\n",
      "- b) Planning and Budgeting\n",
      "- 16. Adequacy  of  budgets. The  budget  estimates  of  the  PforR  Program  will  be  included  in  the  state government budgets. The responsibility for preparing the annual budgets lies with the State Ministries of Planning  and  the  budgets  are  prepared  based  on  the  Medium-term  Expenditure  Framework  (MTEF) documents and on fiscal policy guidelines issued by the State Ministry of Finance. In recent years, the states' annual budgets are passed by the State Houses of Assembly before the commencement of the fiscal year and Governor's assent is secured soon after.\n",
      "- 17. The Program Budget . The Program budget comprises recurrent expenditures of selected MDAs in the 36 states. The process of planning and budgeting does not pose a significant risk to the Program. In compliance with the directive of FAAC to harmonize classification methodologies across the federation, most states have fully transitioned to a new budget and account classification 101 system that is Government Finance Statistics 2001 compliant. Improvements in the linkage of budgets to sector strategies are being recorded across a few states. Considering challenges in realistic costing of the strategies that feed into the budget, these linkages are not highly reliable.\n",
      "- 18. International best practice encourages openness and transparency in budget processes. All states are now expected to publish their budgets and budget implementation outturns on accessible platforms such as their  websites  to  facilitate  public  access.  Currently,  all  states  publish  their  annual  budgets  and  budget implementation performance reports online through their State official websites.\n",
      "- 19. Procurement Arrangements and Planning. For most states, the procurable items under the overhead cost are  not  included  in  the  procurement  plans.  In  addition,  the  procurement  method  used  for  such  items  is difficult to ascertain. Items should be pulled together and procure using a Framework Agreement and call-off\n",

      "## c) Budget execution\n",
      "\n",
      "- 20. Budget  execution. The  federal  government  transacts  its  budgetary  spending  through  a  system  of  a Treasury Single Account (TSA) held with the CBN. At present, all budgetary resources are processed through the  government  integrated  financial  management  information  system  (IFMIS).  Payments  are  made  from MDAs' sub-accounts under TSA with the CBN through a uniform electronic payment platform (REMITA) to finance budgetary expenditures.\n",
      "- 21. At the State level, the control in funds flow is exercised through the State Ministry of Finance and, by extension,  the  offices  of  the  States'  Accountants  Generals,  after  the  budget  release  to  MDAs  is  made through the budget office. Though a few states follow the TSA model by using a particular commercial bank for  collection  of  all  government  funds,  most  states  do  not  use  this.  However,  they  do  maintain  a  cash management system based on a strictly cash budgeting arrangement. Their Consolidated Revenue Funds (CRFs) are held across several selected commercial banks within their respective state and the daily status of cash balances in individual accounts is monitored. Expenditures undergo a process of validation at the MDA level  as  well  as  at  the  accountant-generals'  offices,  and  pre-payment  audits  are  undertaken  on  every expenditure transaction before payment is authorized. Many states now operate a mixture of electronic cash transfers and check system (under a cashless economy policy). Most states execute their payments by check or bank transfer. All the 36 state governments have subscribed to the 22 Point Fiscal Sustainability Strategy and Plan that seeks to support states in reversing their current fiscal management weaknesses, including transitioning to TSA arrangements.\n",
      "- 22. To mitigate the risk of delay in the transfer of Program funds from IDA to the states, it is envisioned that service standards will be established (to be included in the Operations Manual). These aim to ensure, among other things, that funds are transferred to the eligible states' accounts within 14 days of receipt of withdrawn Program funds into the Special Fund Account held with the CBN at the federal level.\n",
      "- 23. Accounting. The Federation has adopted the International Public-Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) accounting fully in January 2016. All states too have adopted the IPSAS accounting. In addition, the federal government and states have all adopted the new chart of accounts and budget classification system, that is Government  Financial  Statistics  (GFS)  2001.  Nigeria  is  moving  progressively  towards  complying  with international standards on accounting and financial reporting as well as on use of a classification methodology (for budgeting, budget execution, accounting, and reporting) that conforms to international best practice. In the majority of states, accounting for and reporting on financial transactions is done using ICT based systems. The system of accounting and financial reporting is generally performed at acceptable levels. The states' treasury  offices  are  endowed  with  adequately  qualified  and  experienced  staff  in  FM.  The  Program expenditures are material in the context of the overall expenditures of the states. The annual State AFS shall include  a  disclosure  note  listing  out  expenditures  for  the  year  and  the  prior  year  for  all  the  constituent elements of the PEF for the state.

The availability of states' audited financial statements is enhanced, as states' audited financial statements are part of the eligibility criteria for SABER and SFTAS and this is required for submission under the CARES Program as well. The financial statements prepared by the State Accountant Generals will include reporting on the recurrent expenditure budget lines in the Program Expenditure Framework (personnel and overhead cost) for the relevant MDAs. The state audited financial statements will be submitted by the states to  the  PCU  once  available.  From  the  audited  financial  statements  submitted  by  the  states,  the  PCU  will undertake  a  compilation  of  the  data  on  recurrent  expenditures  in  line  with  the  Program  Expenditure Framework for all the key implementing MDAs. This compiled report will be shared by the PCU with the World Bank within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year.\n",
      "- 25. Treasury Management and Funds Flow. The IDA credit proceeds of the US$730 million PforR Program will be disbursed to the Federal Government's Special Fund Account, which serves as a sub-account of the TSA held with the CBN. This will be managed by the PCU. Upon receiving the decision to disburse from the World Bank, a withdrawal application will be submitted to the World Bank by the PCU, using the World Bank's standard disbursement forms through the e-disbursement functionality in the World Bank's Client Connection system. Disbursements under PforR will be triggered by the Bank's decision to disburse after receiving and reviewing evidence of the achievement of the Program DLRs through the APA process. The PCU will make disbursements to individual participating states from the Special Fund Account to the respective Consolidated Revenue Fund accounts of the state governments based on the individual state's APA results. No advances under the PforR component are envisaged. To mitigate the risk of delay in the transfer of funds from the FMFBNP to the states, service standards will be established in the Operations Manual to ensure that states' share of funds received in the TSA at the federal level (by virtue of achievement of the DLIs) are transferred to the states' accounts within 14 days from the time of receipt of funds in the Special Fund Account. The funds flow for the PforR Program is provided in schematic form in Figure 3.\n",

The IVA will be hired and funded from the TA IPF component of the Operation with the scope of review acceptable to the World Bank.\n",
      "- d) Internal Controls\n",
      "- 27. Internal controls and Internal Audit. The internal controls over public expenditures is a key area of risk. The internal audit process in at the federal and state government level is largely focused on pre-payment audits. The process lacks in oversight as a support function to internal management. Leakages remain in the expenditure management system due to absence of risk-based internal audit and control processes, and lack of focus on systemic issues. A key challenge will be how to make the internal audit function independent of the expenditure processing cycle and how to give the internal audit function the visibility it deserves.  There have  been  and  there  are  Bank-financed  programs  towards  modernization  of  the  internal  audit  function, including the Nigeria Public Sector Governance Reform and Development Project (P097026 - closed 2017), State and Local Governance Reform Project (P133045 - closed March 2021) and through country-wide PforRs in  the  health  and  education sectors. Support is also provided under the TA component of SFTAS to build capacity in risk-based internal audit functions in a few selected MDAs working with the Institute of Internal Audit, Nigeria.\n",
      "- e) Oversight - Program Audit\n",

The Office of the Auditor General of the Federation as well as the States' Auditor Generals conduct the independent audits of public finances at the federal and the state level, respectively. The submission of the audit  report  (as  well  as  the  financial  statements  upon  receipt  of  the  draft  accounts  from  the  Accountant General of the Federation) to the legislature has generally been achieved within four months of the end of the fiscal year. The quality of audits is seeing improvement especially with the implementation of key reforms supported under the World Bank-financed interventions. There is a progressive transition to International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions. Notwithstanding, audit follow up at the level of the legislature has continued to remain weak.\n",

Given the critical role of the PCU with respect to PforR FM requirements, a FM Specialist may be hired subject to need, to be part of the PCU and to be funded from the IPF component. The FM Specialist will be hired based on terms of reference approved by the Bank and will be supported by the designated Project Accountant. The Project Accountant will coordinate with the respective Head of the Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU) as necessary for the PforR FM requirements.

Consistent  with  OP/BP  9.0 ,  and  as  part  of  the  IFSA,  an  assessment  was  conducted  on  the  existing institutional and oversight systems and practices in Nigeria pertaining to 'Governance and Anticorruption' (GAC)  and  their  applicability  to  the  Program.  The  assessment  examined  the  proposed  design  and implementation of the Program using the Governance framework principles of transparency, accountability, and participation and whether the existing institutions and processes were able to meet requirements of the Guidelines on Preventing and Combating fraud and Corruption in Program-for-Results Financing (February 1, 2012). The assessment examined the extent to which fraud and corruption can surface during implementation and how these can be mitigated under viable action plans and other mitigating factors.\n",

Under  the  Program,  a  protocol  will  be  adopted and  implemented  for  reporting,  management  and investigation  of  fraud  and  corruption  allegations  operationalized  in  the  MDAs  implementing  the  SABER Program. This protocol will be adopted, and the requirement will be included in the Operations Manual. The report on fraud and corruption allegations will be submitted bi-annually as part of implementation progress report. Even if there are no allegations, the PCU will be required to monitor receipt of a positive assertion from all states every six months, that will be compiled and submitted to the World Bank.\n",
      "- 34. The  national  anticorruption  framework  and  agenda  applies  to  all  MDAs  in  Nigeria  -  all  MDAs  are therefore expected to adopt MDA specific frameworks. The anti-corruption legal framework in Nigeria rest largely on the criminal justice system, more specifically the Corrupt Practices and other related offenses Act, 2000; the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004, as well as on the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), ratified in 2004. Additional pieces of legislation address conflict of interest, promote transparency (asset disclosure and freedom of information), and strengthen the governance of extractive industries (Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Act). To institutionalize  the  fight  against  corruption  in  the  country,  the  Government  adopted  a  National  AntiCorruption Strategy (NACS) for the next five years in July 2017. The NACS focuses on prevention of corruption,\n",

All public officers are constitutionally mandated to declare to the Code of Conduct Bureau their assets and liabilities on assumption and term of office, and every four years for permanent employment. Failure of declaration of assets may entail removal from office, disqualification from holding any public office, and forfeiture to the State of any property acquired through abuse of office or dishonestly. State officials are being prosecuted for false declaration of assets.\n",
      "- 36. The Anti-Corruption Institutional Framework . Additional reforms introduced included the prosecution of financial crimes, the management of recovered stolen assets and government overall transparency (under the Open Government Initiative). The Open Government Partnership National Action Plan (OGP NAP) prioritizes fiscal  transparency;  anti-corruption;  access  to  information  and  citizen  engagement  among  others.  The Nigerian  anticorruption  institutional  framework  comprises  multiple  agencies  at  the  Federal  level,  loosely coordinated by the President's Office (within the inter-agency task team on anticorruption). The jurisdiction of these various anti-corruption agencies extends to the state level. The weakest level in the anti-corruption architecture is at the departmental level, with the line ministries' Anti-corruption and Transparency Units (ACTUs). The anti-corruption nodal agency in Nigeria is the Independent Corrupt Practices &amp; Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) but in practice its jurisdiction overlaps with that of the Economic and Financial Crimes  Commission  (EFCC).  The  Technical  Unit  on  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Reforms  (TUGAR), established in 2008 to monitor and evaluate anti-corruption and governance initiatives across all sectors in the country is an important addition for corruption and governance risk assessment: it recently assessed the fiduciary performance of PFM systems in the Nigerian states. Although, the existing legal and institutional frameworks are robust enough to build on, to effectively mitigate against fraud and corruption, there is little evidence that investigations into fraud and corruption are systematically carried out by the law enforcement agencies.\n",

      "- 1. The Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) examines the extent to which the Federal and  State  Government's  existing  environmental  and  social  management  systems :  operates  within,  an adequate legal and regulatory framework to guide environmental and social impact assessments, mitigation, management  and  monitoring  at  the  PforR  Program  level;  and  incorporate  recognized  elements  of  good practice in environmental and social assessment and management. The ESSA thereafter defines measures to strengthen the system and recommends measures that will be integrated into the overall Program. The ESSA is undertaken to ensure consistency with six core principles and key planning elements of PforR ESSA.\n",
      "- 2. The ESSA was prepared by the World Bank team through a combination of detailed reviews of existing Program  materials  and  available  technical  literature,  including  policies,  regulations,  guidelines  and examples of due diligence and design documents, interviews and extensive consultations with government staff (Federal, and State levels). An environmental and social risk screening was undertaken at the concept stage. The ESSA process was informed by the World Bank Guidance on PforR Environmental and Social System Assessment (September 2020).\n",
      "- 3. Consultations were carried out prior to the development of the ESSA. Initial consultations held with government officials and some stakeholders over a period led to the formulation of the SABER Program . The outcomes of those consultations are embedded in this Program and influenced its design. World Bank specialists  consulted  with  different  stakeholders,  especially  federal  and  state  government  agencies.  The consultations were virtual via Microsoft teams meeting. Consultations were held for a sample of Program States, namely Edo, Ekiti and Nasarawa for day one and Enugu, Gombe and Kaduna for day two. Although all states that meet the eligibility criteria can participate in the program, the six states were initially sampled for assessment because of the following reasons: (i) they represent the six political zones; (ii) they are members of the TWG for the SABER program; and (iii) they are likely participating states in the Program. The State teams involved in the consultation comprised of top government officials responsible for the environmental and social management, focal point for SABER in each state, etc. The team held additional consultation where the findings of the assessment was presented to the stakeholders from all states and FCT on August 17, 2022. The ESSA was disclosed prior to this consultation and will be disclosed again after its finalization.\n",
      "- 4. In line with the six core principles outlined in the World Bank's policy and guidance note for the PforR instrument, the relevant risks directly associated with the SABER Program activities and indirectly given the achievement of the program activities under the DLIs and within the proposed Result Areas (RAs) under the PforR covers environmental and social issues and include:\n",
      "- (a) Potential generation of e-waste given the digital data-centric and indexed database for Certificates of Occupancy (CofOs).\n",
      "- (b) In  case  of  poor  implementation  of  FRILIA,  induced  increase  pollution  due  to  environmentally unsustainable agriculture practices.\n",
      "- (c) Indirectly,  temporary  displacement  of  people,  primarily  low-income  people  selling  their  wares  or residing along the right-of-way for the deployment of fiber optic network.\n",
      "- (d) Indirectly, the expansion and deployment of fiber optic networks given standardized ROW fees will lead to the generation of dust resulting in air pollution.\n",
      "- (e) Indirectly,  there  could  be  increase  in  carbon emissions due to use of off-grid diesel generators at cellular sites linked to fiber deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "- (f) Indirectly, there may be GBV and SH due to the influx of workers deploying fiber optic networks.\n",
      "- (g) Indirectly, expected  environmental  and  social  risks, such  as risks due  to construction and rehabilitation and involuntary resettlement associated with PPP projects (that may materialize after Program completion), given weak E&amp;S systems in most states.\n",
      "- 5. The overall environmental and social risks have been assessed and deemed to be Moderate. Although the Program will not support construction work, the achievement of new ROW fees at maximally NGN145 per meter may indirectly lead to the expansion of fiber optic networks by the private sector (not financed by the Program), which will involve some minor construction which will not lead to displacement considering this will be limited to existing ROW. Also, the establishment of a robust PPP framework may indirectly lead to PPP projects involving construction and rehabilitation (after the Program period).  Actual Program activities are thus not likely to require significant changes to the Borrower's overall environmental and social systems. The program  was  generally  assessed  as  moderate  because  some  improvements  in  environmental  and  social management approaches are expected through the Program despite the envisaged environmental and social risks outlined in section III. Overall, the Program risks and impacts are not likely to be significant, not complex, low in magnitude, predictable and expected to be temporary and/or reversible; and low probability of serious adverse  effects  to  human  health  and/or  the  environment  and  mitigation  measures  are  readily  available, including use of exclusion list.\n",
      "- 6. Some analyses were carried out to determine the range of environmental and social risks and benefits associated with the PforR Program based on each of the DLIs . The PforR Program will deliver some direct and indirect environmental and social benefits. For example, some direct and indirect environmental risks associated with DLI1 include the generation of e-waste given the increased use of ICT in land administration, such as the digital data-centric for land documentation and indexed database for Certificates of Occupancy (CofOs). Also, pilot implementation of the Framework for Responsible and Inclusive Land Intensive Agricultural Investments  (FRILIA)  may  be  associated  with  some  environmental  risks  due  to  slippage  from  sustainable agricultural practices (i.e., poor implementation of FRILIA), possibly resulting in uncontrolled pesticide and fertilizer application; habitat alteration; and carbon emissions. However, the Program does not finance poor implementation of FRILIA, and instead only disburses against the successful pilot implementation of FRILIA, as confirmed by a social audit. Furthermore, the Program aims to encourage the private sector to invest in deployment  of  the  broadband  network  through  achieving  new  ROW  fees  at  NGN145  per  meter  in  DLI2. Indirectly, this private sector deployment would involve clearing and the excavation of soils to lay optic fiber cables. These activities, in turn, will result in environmental consequences, for example, the generation of waste and dust resulting  in  air  pollution  and  risks  of  obstructing  drainage  networks  and  water  pollution. Indirectly, e-waste will also be generated from the deployment of the broadband network and indirectly be generated from ICT applications associated with it, for example, data centers, and e-administration platforms. E-waste causes air, water and land pollution and poses human health risks.\n",
      "- 7. In addition, some environmental benefits are associated with the Program . Achieving DLI1 is expected to  limit  land  grabbing  for  investments  and  its  ecological  consequences,  especially  uncontrolled  land  use change which could result in increased carbon emissions, erosion and land degradation. Also, there is the possibility  of  reduced  carbon  emissions  from  improved  land  management  for  agriculture.  Improved transparency and sustainability in property registration will also reduce uncontrolled land use change and its consequences. In addition, strengthening the social and environmental framework of land allocation through the  adoption  and  implementation  of  FRILIA  can  help  forestall  biodiversity  loss  and  serve  as  an  enabling\n",

      "\n",
      "The World Bank environment  for  the  achievement  of  land  degradation  neutrality  (LDN)  in  the  states.  Also,  increased deployment, access, and use of the broadband network given new ROW fees of NGN145/meter, as covered in DLI2, could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is because the use of broadband internet could facilitate reduced movement of people to offices as they work from home, thus reducing the amount of fossil fuel burnt and the associated reduction in emissions. Thus, companies can reduce both their energy use for keeping people in offices and the associated emissions. Person hour lost in traffic which can be used for production will also be reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 8. The SABER Program is also associated with some social risks. For example, social risks as a result of DLI 1  could  indirectly  result  from  ineffective  GRM  in  land  acquisition,  thus  impacting  livelihoods  and  living standards,  especially  of  the  vulnerable  groups,  negatively.  Indirectly,  there  could  be  elite  capture,  the challenge regarding title owner determination, gender-based violence (GBV) and sexual harassment (SH) due to poor land acquisition and resettlement procedures. The achievement of FRILIA would help to mitigate some of these risks. Furthermore, the achievement of DLI 2 may, indirectly, due to reduced ROW fees, lead to the temporary displacement of people, primarily low-income people selling their wares or residing along the rightof-way. In addition, in case of the lack of an effective GRM, the system may not appropriately redress the grievance of those impacted due to the deployment of fiber optic networks. It thus may negatively impact the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable people. Also, deploying fiber optic networks may harm workers and public safety. There could also be GBV and SH due to the influx of workers deploying fiber optic networks.\n",
      "- 9. The achievement of DLI3 could indirectly lead to land acquisition and resettlement issues due to a PPP project  that  may  be implemented after Program closure. For  example, this DLI  could  indirectly  result  in voluntary or involuntary land acquisition and grievances among people who may be displaced from lands for PPP projects that may be implemented after the Program has been completed, due to the establishment of a robust PPP framework in the participating states, especially where the land acquisition process for PPP is not well spelt out. It could enhance underlying tensions between landowners and pose a security risk, especially where property rights are not well defined. The achievement of FRILIA (under the Program) would help to mitigate some of these risks that may occur (outside the scope of the Program).\n",
      "- 10. In addition, a lot of social benefits are associated with the Program. For example, some direct social benefits  from  DLI1  include  secure  property  rights,  effective  monitoring  of  land  use,  increased  inflow  of investments, and increased access to finance for investment purposes. Also, there is a possibility of increased government revenue from property tax, land rent and fees, and increased investment in development projects due to increased government revenue, and hence reduced poverty and enhanced livelihoods. Some benefits for  firms  include  reduced  operational  costs,  and  increased  production,  output  and  revenue.  Enhanced performance and increased revenue from firms also translate to increased revenue for the government from sales  and income taxes. Also, achieving this DLI will equally lead to increased employment opportunities, increased employee income/productivity and reduced poverty.\n",
      "- 11. Following the identification of environmental and social risks, the E&amp;S management systems in place to manage the identified risks were assessed. The assessment was done using the following criteria: strengths of the system, or where it functions effectively and efficiently and is consistent with World Bank Policy and Directive  for  Program-for-Results  Financing;  inconsistencies  and  gaps  between  the  principles  espoused  in Bank Policy and Directive for Program-for-Results Financing and capacity constraints; actions to strengthen\n",

      "\n",
      "- (a) There is a need to include E&amp;S considerations in the PPP framework adopted by participating states (DLI3). State governments and private companies that will approve and deploy fiber optic networks should ensure that adequate legally binding controls and staffing are included in the procurement and supervision phases of civil works.\n",
      "- (b) State  governments should  institute  a  scheduled  program  to  build  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of technical staff of the States Ministry of Environment and the PCU to be able to manage and monitor environmental  assessments  processes,  environmental  monitoring  to  ensure  pollution  control, hazards and other environmental issues in the state. In the long run, there is a need to equip the State Ministries  of  Environment  with  necessary  facilities  and  equipment  (including  laboratories  and monitoring devices for monitoring environmental parameters). Participating states' MDAs responsible  for  broadband  deployment  need  to  formulate/develop  guidelines  and  manuals  for mainstreaming  stakeholder  engagement  processes,  environmental,  and  OHS  issues,  into  the implementation of DLI2.\n",
      "- (c) There is a need to develop a standard procedure for consultation with   all Program-affected persons along the ROW (for DLI2).\n",
      "- (d) There is need to develop an effective Program-wide GRM system that aligns with state ADR system so complainants and businesses (especially small-scale businesses and those that do not have the capacity to use the courts) can leverage on for resolution of their concerns.\n",
      "- (e) There is a need to increase the capacity and effective framework to handle GBV, SH and SEA.\n",

      "- 1. The Implementation Support Plan (ISP) is designed based on the residual risks identified in the SORT assessment in addition to other technical, fiduciary, environmental, and social gaps noted by the World Bank team. These findings in addition to lessons learned from implementation of SFTAS, and other past and ongoing operations will inform the frequency of implementation support. However, flexibility is built into the ISP  to  address  unexpected  implementation  challenges  as  they  arise  and  to  allow  for  quick  adjustments throughout the life of the Program. Both physical and virtual implementation support missions will be carried out regularly with Program review conducted twice a year. On-demand support and implementation guidance will be provided throughout the life of the Program by technical experts from the World Bank and appropriate external consultants.\n",
      "- 2. Implementation Support will cover multiple facets of the Program, given its complexity and scope. It will  include  (i)  reviews  of  implementation  progress  and  achievement  of  Program  results  and  DLIs;  (ii) monitoring of the adequacy of systems deployed and their compliance with legal agreements; and (iii) support to the PCU in monitoring changes in risks to the Program. Moreover, there will be advisory and technical assistance activities, critical for the achievement of DLIs, as identified in the PAP (Annex 6).\n",
      "- 3. The World Bank team supporting this Program will be comprised of technical experts, mainly from the Finance, Competitiveness, and Innovation (FCI) Global Practice (GP) regional and global teams, with support from  experts  in  other  technical  areas . Contributing  GPs  include  Digital  Development,  Governance, Macroeconomics,  Trade  and  Investment,  Urban,  Resilience  and  Land  and  Infrastructure  Finance,  PPPs  &amp; Guarantees.  The  core  team  will  include  business  regulatory  environment  specialists,  tax  administration specialists,  trade  specialists,  digital  development  specialists,  investment  policy  and  promotion  specialists, public-private partnership specialists, land administration specialists, judicial reform specialists, and financial management, procurement, environmental and social specialists, many of whom are based in Abuja.  The team will review the implementation progress towards the achievement of the PDO, provide technical support to implementing agencies, assist in enhancing local capacity, and monitor residual project risk and continued compliance with the legal agreement.\n",
      "- 4. Implementation support and field visits will be carried out as required, and will focus on:\n",
      "- (a) Technical inputs . The World Bank will make available relevant specialists/consultants for all formal implementation support missions, as well as on-demand technical requests throughout the life of the Program. The support in the first year or two will be intensive to rollout the program. In addition, the World  Bank  will  sponsor  periodic  video  conference  technical  reviews  to  address  implementation issues related to the four results areas.\n",
      "- (b) Fiduciary  requirements  and  inputs .  The  assessments  conducted  have  highlighted  the  need  for capacity building for the implementing  agencies.  Supervision  of  financial management  and procurement arrangements will be carried out as required as part of the Program supervision plan and support will be provided on a timely basis to respond to program needs.\n",

The US$20 million IPF Component for technical assistance (the 'Project') has two sub-components: (1) Strengthening State Government Systems and Capacities; and (2) Strengthening Program Coordination and Verification of Results. The first component will be the largest, focusing on providing capacity support to all participating state governments to strengthen their systems and capacities to enable them to achieve the Program results (the DLRs). The IPF Component will be delivered by selected national-level institutions who are  critical  for  supporting  state  governments  to  achieve  Program  results  as  well  as  to  strengthen  state government capacities in a sustainable manner.\n",
      "- 2. National-level institutions will act as the implementing agencies for the Project: the PCU housed in the FMFBNP HFD will hire an external firm as IVA. The PCU will engage the NGF as a project management firm to support the PCU to implement specific capacity building and learning activities, including technical workshops on the RAs and DLIs, customized just-in-time hands on support at the individual state level through mobile teams and the NGF's helpdesks, and peer learning forums to facilitate learning across states on the RAs and DLIs of the Program. EBES is expected to play a critical role through its subnational interventions, including a strong performance tracking element, and its leadership role through the TWG. In addition, on DLI5 (increased transparency of official fees and procedures) and DLI8 (quick determination of commercial disputes), EBES will provide intense technical support to the participating states and EBES will also take the lead on private sector engagement. All procurement under the IPF component will be conducted by the PCU.\n",
      "- 3. The proposed extension of SFTAS (till June 2023) will be used to support early implementation of SABER, especially  the  preparation,  communication,  and  TA  support  to  achieve  the  Prior  Results  and  their verification, and initial support towards the first year's DLRs . This will be done through contract amendments of the third party external audit firm to include verification of the Prior Results, contract amendment of the Program Management Firm to include support to SABER preparation, communications, hands-on TA and verification, to the states towards achieving the Prior Results and the first year DLRs, the extension of select PCU consultants (program management, financial management, communications, budget), and the hiring of select new PCU members (social, environmental and procurement specialists).\n",

PEBEC-EBES  is  expected  to  continue  to  play  its  critical  role  through  its  subnational  interventions, including a strong performance tracking element, and its leadership role through the TWG . In the results areas where PEBEC-EBES has built up expertise, PEBEC-EBES will design and provide resource persons for technical workshops, clinics and train the trainers. PEBEC-EBES is also expected to organize the private sector engagement: Organized private sector, if engaged meaningfully and constructively, can be a sounding board for reform identification as well as a 'watchdog' of the Program's progress towards its objectives. Organized private sector is a member in PEBEC and the TWG. With SABER expected to operate in most, if not all, states and covering reform action for firms of all sizes, the private sector would ideally be organized in a similar way. Micro and small firms are less organized; however, it was agreed that efforts should be made to get inputs from all sizes of firms. In addition, through the DLIs/DLRs, opportunities for the private sector to get handson support (through IPAs), report concerns, and hold State MDAs accountable for government-to-business services will be improved. Finally, PEBEC-EBES also systematically engages the private sector through a survey for its subnational EODB report.\n",
      "- 8. The PCU will engage the NGF as a project management firm to support the PCU to implement specific capacity building and learning activities. The project management firm will support the PCU to implement specific capacity building and learning activities, including organizing technical workshops and clinics on the DLIs, customized just-in-time hands on support at the individual state level through mobile teams and the NGF's helpdesks, and peer learning forums to facilitate learning across States on the DLIs of the Program. For SFTAS, NGF played this role, and was critical to the success of SFTAS, due to: (i) its ability to leverage highlevel engagement platforms, such as the NGF Monthly Meetings to engage with State Governors on a regular basis; (ii) the establishment of high-level program monitoring and engagement mechanisms, such as the NGF SFTAS Committee chaired by Edo State Governor; and (iii) its HelpDesk Progamme, which has institutionalized tools and methods for effectively developing and disseminating toolkits, providing just-in-time customized technical support, and peer learning events for all states.\n",

The IPF Component will support coordinating efforts of MDAs to collect baseline and end-of-program data for the intermediate results that will be inputs into the verification process. Lessons learned from IVAs in Nigeria, which will be applied to the IVA for SABER, include the following: (1) start procurement of IVA well ahead of Program effectiveness; (2) irrespective of contract size, consider IVA contracts as 'prior review' contracts, to ensure close implementation support; (3) explore direct verification; (4) IVA terms of references (TORs) can build on TORs used for previous PforRs; (5) make the PCU responsible for contracting the IVA, as the PCU has an interest in starting the Program on time; (6) prepare the verification protocol  prior  to  Board  approval;  (7)  consider  pilot  testing  the  verification  to  identify  weaknesses  and inconsistencies in the verification protocol as well as make states aware of what is expected of them; and (8) regular updating of the verification protocol is necessary.\n",
      "- 11. Support will be provided for the HFD as the PCU. This will be achieved through consultants, who will work as  specialists  within  the  PCU,  alongside  seconded  staff  from  the  FMFBNP,  on  specific  areas  of  Program management: Program supervision, Communications and Outreach, Procurement, Financial Management, and Environmental &amp; Social Risk Management. The PCU will largely be a continuation of the SFTAS PCU, with limited  adjustments  to  reflect  the  differences  between  SFTAS  and  SABER  and  to  address  gaps  and performance  weaknesses  (procurement)  currently  in  the  SFTAS  PCU.  This  will  facilitate  the  accelerated effectiveness of the Operation and early disbursements under the Program.\n",
      "- 12. Communications and outreach .  The PCU will carry out a regular extensive program of communication and outreach activities with State Governments on the Program. The World Bank will work alongside the PEBEC-EBES and PCU to design and organize activities with all Program stakeholders to enable regular dialogue and information sharing - starting before Program effectiveness and throughout the duration of the Program. It is envisaged that at least twice a year, there will be a peer forum convening key stakeholders across States to collectively review progress (based on the results of the APA), showcase and learn from success, identify implementation challenges, and problem-solve, and plan for the next year of the Program. The forums will leverage  existing  communities  of  practice  for  state  commissioners  of  finance,  budget,  and  planning.  The Communications Specialist will assist the Program Manager to implement and coordinate these activities, possibly supported by a digital communications specialist.\n",

The Procurement Plan will be updated, as necessary and in agreement with the Bank, annually to reflect the Project's actual implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. Advance procurement of key TA activities will be critical.\n",
      "- 17. The  World  Bank  has  assessed  the  above  arrangements. The  main  procurement  risks  identified,  and mitigation measures agreed are as follows: Federal Ministry of Finance, Home Finance Department (HFD): The requirement to implement all procurement activities include procurement post review activities in real time is not adhered to by HFD PCU. SFTAS faced a weak procurement function for the IPF component, with key large  procurements  under  the  Project  delayed  and  having  impacted  Program  implementation.  A  new procurement specialist will be hired and a refresher training on STEP will be organized for the PCU before the commencement of procurement implementation.\n",

The PCU will engage the NGF as a Project Management Firm to support the implementation and management of the TA activities. The PCU will also engage the IVA and select firms and consultants in case dedicated specialized TA support for some DLRs is needed, where PEBEC and NGF do not have the expertise and/or capacity to deliver this. The FPFMD (Federal Project Financial Management Department),  established  in  the  Office  of  the  Accountant  General  of  the  Federation  (OAGF),  will  be responsible for managing the financial affairs of the Project along with the PCU. The FPFMD has been assessed and found to be acceptable for the implementation of World Bank-assisted projects. A Project Accountant and a Project Internal Auditor will be assigned to the PCU by the FPFMD, and they will be subject to clearance by the Bank. Given the PCU's larger role with regards to financial management on the PforR component, an FM consultant may be hired, if needed. The consultant will be funded from the TA and will be hired under TOR acceptable to the Bank.\n",
      "- 22. Budgeting. Budget preparation will follow the federal government's procedures as appropriate. PCU will prepare the annual project budget based on the TA work plan. The annual work plan and budget will be submitted by the PCU to the Bank for approval at least two months prior to the start of the fiscal year. There are adequate procedures in place for planning and budgeting.\n",
      "- 23. Accounting and Financial Reporting. The TA funds will be accounted for by HFD using its computerized accounting system. The annual financial statements for the IPF component will be prepared in accordance with the relevant IPSAS. The bi-annual IFRs and the annual project financial statements will be generated from the accounting system. Quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs) will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by the PCU within 45 days from the end of each calendar quarter. The PCU is familiar with the format for financial reporting under the SFTAS IPF component, and the same format will be followed for SABER.\n",

      "- 1. Climate vulnerability context . In Nigeria, climate change impacts are expected to have significant impacts on livelihoods and the broader economy 91 . Changes in precipitation and temperature, increase in risks of droughts and floods affect the country's agriculture, water, energy and infrastructure. Nigeria's mean annual temperature  ranges  between  17°C  to  37°C  in  the  south  to  12°C  to  45°C  in  the  north.  For  the  country, temperature increases of 0.03°C per decade were observed between 1901-2016, with stronger increases occurring over the last 30 years of 0.19°C per decade. According to analysis from the German Climate Service Center (GERICS) of 32 Global Climate Models (GCMs), temperatures across Nigeria are expected to increase by  2.9°C  to  as  much  as  5.7°C  by  end  of  the  century. 92 The  annual  variation  of  rainfall,  particularly  in  the northern parts, is large. This has resulted in climatic hazards, especially floods and droughts. Observed rainfall patterns indicate that rainfall for the country over the past century declined by approximately 80 centimeters (cm). 93\n",
      "- 2. Nigeria is classified as one of the ten most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change and natural hazards . 94 Nigeria is regularly affected by multiple hazards such as floods and droughts. Furthermore, low-income households are the most vulnerable to weather-related natural disasters. 95 Agriculture, which is heavily impacted by flooding and drought, serves as the main source of income for 80 percent of the rural poor. An estimated 24 percent of Nigeria's population (approximately 41 million people) are living in high climate exposure areas. Increased food insecurity is also of specific concern following disasters which result in land and infrastructure degradation due to erosion, direct crop failure due to floods and heavy rains, and possible nutrient leaching, and fungal growth due to increased humidity. Water availability will be affected by possible periods of drought. 96 Given the dependency of Nigeria's economy on climate-sensitive industries (agriculture,  forestry,  oil,  and  gas  extraction),  climate  change  inaction  could  cost  Nigeria  between  6-30 percent by 2050, equivalent to a loss of US$100-460 billion. 97\n",
      "- 3. The role of tenure security and responsible land-based investment in agriculture in climate change is multifaceted. Limited  tenure  security  disincentivizes  long-term  investments  by  farmers  in  climate-smart agriculture as well as reforestation. The lack of up-to-date land records hinders efficient interventions to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Agriculture is a highly climate sensitive industry. This heightens the need for sustainable private investment in agriculture that ensures tenure security, mitigates environmental degradation and ensures food security.\n",

The core principles to be included in the framework are broader than the standard E&amp;S policy. The Framework includes principles such as that the investment should be consistent with and contribute to the state's overarching policy objective, which include the realization of a climate-resilient economy, food security, improved land use, among others.\n",
      "- 5. Once adopted, the framework applies to all large-scale land-intensive private investment projects in agriculture materialized through the framework in a given state going forward, beyond the scope of the WBG operation .    Its  adoption mainstreams climate change adaptation and mitigation measures into such investments in a sustainable way.\n",
      "- (a) First, it foresees for all such private investments to have adequate safeguards against environmental damage unless adequately mitigated. This is to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the investment project lifespan, or, if unavoidable, to design appropriate actions to proactively mitigate the potential impacts.\n",
      "- (b) Second,  investments  have  to  be  preceded  by  independent  assessments  of  potential  positive  and negative impacts on tenure rights, food security, livelihoods, and the environment. This policy is to safeguard against the destruction of biodiversity that could lead to significant GHG emission, protect the ecosystem from climate exacerbations such as flooding, provide alternatives to deforestation, and promote processes such as climate friendly crop variety selection, agroecology, among others.\n",
      "- (c) Third, it requires a resettlement policy framework to provide guidance on how anticipated risks and impacts on land acquisition procedures would be managed, including protection against climate risks such as greenhouse gas emission and destruction of biodiversity buffers such as wetlands and green canopy areas.\n",
      "- (d) Fourth, it ensures that such investment is materialized in a way that respects land tenure security and promotes out-grower participation. Evidence shows that when land tenure is secure that landowners are  incentivized  to  make  long-term  investments,  which  would  not  occur  in  a  low  tenure  security context. The literature confirms that secure tenure provides incentives for long-term investments in climate-smart  agriculture  and  collateral  for  financing  these  investments. 98 Hence,  the  project activities would provide incentives to farmers for increasing climate-smart agriculture. The same is true for reforestation: Lack or insecure land tenure rights prevents smallholders to engage with tree planting and agroforestry as these require stable long-term commitment. 99\n",
      "- (e) Lastly, the framework supports climate change adaptation measures related food security risks. Food insecurity substantively increased in Nigeria due to climate change. The framework recommends the development  of  a  food  security  plan  to  ensure  that  commercial  scale  production  of  agro-allied products does not limit access of the community members to food for survival. The food security plan will take into account climate risks and address climate vulnerability of crops, including sustainable plans  for  ecologically  friendly  staples  and  climate-resilient  crops  (depending  on  the  cultural preferences), market gardens and kitchen gardens. It serves to protect the biodiversity, the nutrition\n",

      "- 6. The principles underlying the framework are based on the FAO Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the context of National Food Security, as well as the FAO Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems . It also draws on international good practice for environmental management, land acquisition and resettlement.  The experience of Kaduna provides a case example. FRILIA takes approximately 50 percent of the total allocation to DLI 1 out of which 75 percent (at least, 3 out of the 4 principles) activities will contribute directly to climate change adaptation measures. For example, the principle on state land acquisition and resettlement involves the identification of climate-change impact (as part of the economic and social impact) resulting from land acquisition and use pattern. Also, FRILIA's overarching investment principles will support states to develop land-based investment policies that considers climate-change and disaster risks such as flooding, disaster etc.\n",
      "- 7. The  DLI  on  the  development  of  an  effective  PPP  framework  for  states ensures  that established institutional and legal framework incorporates a climate-change and disaster risk disclosure requirement. Additionally, PPP pipeline prepared and adopted by State-level PPP coordination unit/agency will be screened for climate adaptation and mitigation. This will support state governments to ascertain whether the pipeline project aligns with its adaptation and mitigation objectives. The DLI has seven DLRs out of which three are climate-change  adaptation  measures  -  PPP  pipeline  adoption  and  climate  screening,  development  and publication of PPP legal and institutional framework that mandates the disclosure of PPP projects including climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  aspects,  and  the  publication  of  the  PPP  information  on  a  web-based disclosure portal. The portal will disclose climate change related information including the identified risks throughout PPP lifecycle. The climate screening and disclosure mandate, which is carried out together with other  PPP  screening  parameters,  is  intended  to  promote  climate  integrative  thinking  in  the  overall  PPP framework and facilitate adoption of climate adaptation and mitigation measures in the PPP process  such as integrating  risk,  potential  resilience  options,  and  co-benefits  into  the  business  case,  integrating  climate requirements in the procurement process including the technical specification and output indicators, and articulating clear climate smart considerations in the PPP agreement that the private partner must meet etc.\n",
      "- 8. DLIs  on  improved  transparency  of  official  fees,  procedures  and  service  delivery  timelines,  and  the establishment of e-payment platforms for taxes, levies and fees will directly contribute to climate-change mitigation through CO2 emissions reduction. Increased use of electronic platforms for the collection of taxes, levies, and fees from businesses and automated e-receipt generation for at least five key business enabling MDAs 100   is  likely  to  substantially  reduce  the  greenhouse  gas emissions  that  emanate from the process of physical payments, where businesses have to visit the relevant state revenue collection agencies. Increased transparency  through  publication  of  official  fees,  service  delivery  timelines  and  procedures  for  obtaining documents such as Certificates of Occupancy (CofOs), construction permits, trade-related schedule of fees, inventory of incentives on a state's official website is also likely to have a similar effect. The use of an electronic payment and automated e-receipt generation platform and remote access to states and local government official fees and procedures for benefiting from government's services will save businesses physical trips.\n",
      "\n",
      "100 Enabling business MDAs include agencies in charge of urban and regional planning, ministry of commerce and industries, boards of internal revenue service, ministries or agencies in charge of lands, housing and survey, ministries of environment and water resources, agencies in charge of vehicle registration and states signage and advertising agencies.\n",

      "- 9. There are over 41 million MSMEs in Nigeria as of 2017 according to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) and these businesses are expected to pay some form of taxes, levies and fees to state governments . According to EBES' subnational baseline report, businesses in Nigeria pay on average five different taxes every year. Likewise, for the SABER Program, it is expected that states would need to publish no fewer than seven business enabling information - procedures, fees, service delivery timelines for. Without electronic payment platforms and functional state websites where these businessenabling information are published, the counterfactual is that businesses would have to take a lot of physical trips to the relevant offices, which can have implications on CO2 emission. It can be assumed that at least 15 States (out of the 36 states and FCT) would sign up for any of these climate risk mitigating DLIs - DLI1, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n",
      "- 10. It is assumed that businesses in the participating states make at least five trips per annum 101 to the relevant office or agency where they need to collect receipt, make enquiries on fees, procedures, service delivery  timelines,  and  sometimes,  carry  out  reconciliations .  Given  the  complexity  and  opacity  of  the Nigerian  tax  and  service  delivery  systems  at  the  subnational  level,  we  anticipate  that  small  and  micro businesses  without  dedicated  tax/legal  departments  are  likely  to  make  more  visits.  Examples  of  these payments include business premises permit registration and renewal, signage and advertisement fees, land use charge, vehicle license renewals, waste disposal fees, etc. Additionally, we consider the multiple means of transportation 102 at the disposal of the business and use the data 103 provided by the International Energy Agency on GHG intensity by passenger transport modes to estimate emissions by transportation mode. We estimate that at least 84 million trips are taken annually across Nigeria's 15 participating States in the most conservative case resulting in close to 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere annually.\n",
      "- 11. The electronic platforms (both for payment and to access business enabling information) are expected to last at least 10 years 104 before a replacement is necessary and has the potential to directly lead to lower emissions by up to 3.4 million kg of GHG in the conservative case over the lifetime of the platform . Taking into account a rebound effect of 20 percent 105 as increased efficiency may result in more demand for the epayment  services  and  subsequently  more  energy  consumption  which  ultimately  can  lead  to  more  GHG emissions. In addition, the likely increase in emissions associated with an uptick in the use of computers 106 when  performing  transactions  need  to  be  considered.  Having  considered  the  potential  increase  in  GHG emissions associated with the program, there would still be about 260,000 tons of GHG savings annually directly associated with the use of the e-platform and publication of business-enabling information on state official websites.\n",

Further the cost of GHG emissions is computed using the shadow price of carbon (SPC) methodology 107 applied by the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices where a cost of US$40-US$80 is associated with each ton of GHG gas emission. This does not consider related social costs of pollution which are harder to compute. In the most conservative case, the value of the mitigation as a direct consequence of the electronic platforms is about US$95-US$105 million and this value can grow significantly larger when more complexity is added into the model.\n",
